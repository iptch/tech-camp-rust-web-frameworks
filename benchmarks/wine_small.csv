"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew."
"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby."

In this good everyday sipping wine, flavors that range from pear to barely ripe pineapple prove approachable but not distinctive."

"White flower, lychee and apple aromas carry the mellow bouquet. The chunky-feeling palate bears powdery, sweet flavors of peach and melon, mixed with greener notes of grass and lime.

"Grown on the sandy soil of Tejo, the wine is typically soft and open. It is very accessibleâ€”with black fruits and light tannins for this grape. It is ready to drink."
"Caramelized oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a barrel-heavy nose. This feels a bit choppy, with astringent tannins. Herbal salty plum flavors wear a lot of oaky makeup, while this finishes with a forced woody flavor."
"Bland, mature aromas of white fruits are on the weak side for AlbariÃ±o. This feels round and oily, while briny leesy flavors lack pop and precision. A grabby aged finish is short on the free flow that this grape and region are known for. Drink immediately or wait for a newer vintage."
"This fruity, sweet wine is immediately attractive and ripe. With its great apricot and pineapple fruit, hints of spicy wood and balancing acidity, it's perfect as an apÃ©ritifâ€”light and refreshing. Drink now."

Drink now through 2020.

The lean linear palate shows dried sour cherry, licorice and coffee bean alongside assertive close-grained tannins. Even though the tannins are still firm, drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit."
"This blends 20% each of all five red-Bordeaux varieties, showing grapy, plummy flavor that's juicy and soft on the palate. With a core of tobacco, tar and graphite, it complements the fruity with the savory, ending simply and elegantly."

Very long, juicy, lingering finish."

A full rich palate, slightly soft, it begins to run out of steam a little in mid palate, but returns with a flourish, and the finish is long and nuanced. Will repay 5+ years of cellaring."
"The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine. Lots of toasty new oak adds buttered toast and vanilla, but the wood influence is in balance. Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent."
"Defines Rockpile Zinfandel in intensity of fruit and high alcohol which is in keeping with the volume. There are few red wines in the world like this. It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable. Demands the richest grilled meats and cheeses."
"The blend is roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Cabernet, and the result combines berries with cassis and generosity with structure, all framed by toasty oak. Savory in character, long and dusty on the finish. Drink now-2018."

Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now."
"Etienne Le Riche is a total Cabernet specialist. With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense. The Reserve Cabernets are, of course, the stars. This 2003 is fruit and wood driven, a powerful but still elegant wine, with black plums, tannins and super-ripe fruits."
"Mid-gold color. Pronounced and enticing aromas of ripe citrus and stone fruit, layered with honey and floral notes with a touch of sweet spice. Rich and creamy texture packed with sweet ripe juicy fruit, honey, spice and a twist of sage. Off-dry, deliciously smooth with fresh acidity and medium-body. An elegant wine with a long, creamy, spicy finish."

Strong minerality follows through to a long, precise, juicy finish."
"Compelling minerality on the nose, Refined and focused floral aromas with ample ripe stone fruit and a hint of petrol. Racy acidity and lovely taut palate with generous layers of juicy ripe peach, apricot and nectarine.  Strong minerality prevails across the palate leading to a lingering finish. Very balanced."
"A big, black bruiser of a wine that has black olive flavors and aromas and plenty beyond. Raspberry, mulberry, vanilla and spice all vie on the nose, while the palate is so dark itÂ´s tough to discern the plum and leather flavors. Give it three years and reap the benefits."
"At the first it was quite muted and subdued, but over a ten minute period it developed beautifully in the glass. The dark fruit is still dominant, but it is beginning to show some interesting tertiary aromas of earth, mushrooms and leather. Well balanced with a medium finish. Needs a few more years, but can be enjoyed now with a good deal of pleasure."
"Attractive mid-gold color. Compelling layers of tangy citrus and stone fruit aromas with notes of honey and earthy minerality. Intense flavors of honey, tangy orange citrus, sweet peach and apricot that are both rich and juicy.  Crisp acidity provides a perfect balance for the slight sweetness on the finish. Taut and focused."
"A Cabernet-dominated (98%) wine, which boasts a dense, concentrated tannic structure. Flavors of cassis underly this, while the wood spices contribute their ribbon of flavor. This is an impressive wine, the flagship red from this estate founded by Spatz Sperling over 30 years ago."
"Einaudi's wines have been improving lately, and this Barolo was very impressive, given the trying conditions of the vintage. Big rich, fat with smoked meat and a good dose of oak, the wine was one of the few that didn't peter out early but stayed on the palate to the end, culminating in an nice easy finish."
"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least."
"The color is just beginning to show signs of browning at the edge, but the wine is still fresh and vibrant. The nose is complex, showing licorice, summer fruits, caramel and roses. On the palate, it is soft and pleasant, but lacks some concentration.  At its peak, but will drink well for a few years."
"This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward pruneâ€”no doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer. It's creamy and supple in texture, adding just enough tobacco, vanilla and smoke for complexity. But for all the fruit and ripeness, it finishes with great elegance and precision. Drink nowâ€“2020. Imported by Acadia Imports."
"This is great Chenin Blanc, wood fermented but still leaving all the varietal character. Rich, creamy, almond flavors and silky smooth, which keeps all the essential acidity of the grape, with added spice and vanilla."
"Mid-gold color. Very mineral driven with subtle aromas of bruised apple and stone fruit compote. Crisp, fairly taut palate showing strong minerality and ripe flavors of red apple, cantaloupe, sweet nectarine and spice. Taut and precise texture with a long, slightly austere finish."
"Beautiful deep gold color. Intense, concentrated nose with vibrant aromas of honey, citrus marmalade and savory botrytis notes. Deliciously sweet and succulent, yet balanced by good acidity.  Packed with flavors of sweet ultra-ripe stone and tropical fruit, with honey and botrytis notes following through. Strong minerality prevails to a long, complex finish."
"A big, fat, luscious wine with plenty of toasty oak, dark jammy fruit and spices. The palate showed the same lushness; with the fruit front and center with surprising length.  A delicious, rather hefty effort short on finesse but long on flavor."
"This is one of the more complex wines from the 2003 vintage. The nose has aromas of blackberry liquer, smoked meat, truffle and road tar. On the palate the fruit seems a little heavier and more roasted, but still melds well with its earthy, mushroomy flavors. Medium finish."
"A beautiful wine, sleek, crisp and ultra-dry, with the most refined flavors of petrol, white peach, kaffir lime, apricot skin and minerals. The acidity is very high and palate-cleansing. The wine was half fermented in barrels, half in stainless steel. Sommeliers, buy this by the case, if you can find it."
"Rich gold in color. Broad, layered aromas of very ripe fruit with hints of sweet smoke, brown sugar, honey and a savory earthy minerality. Full-bodied, bone dry, but richly textured with crisp acidity and a wide palette of flavors, ripe stone fruit, a creamy savory earthiness, sage and a balsamic kick on the finish. Very long length, slightly warm but with a lingering savory, mineral finish."
"Thick and brooding, this dark, sweetly tannic wine also offers higher-toned elements of cedar, dried herb and graphite. It finds its balance amid a full-bodied density of fruit concentration and girth of structure. Drink now through 2023."
"Cooked cranberry is spiced with anise, peppercorn and roasted beef slices on this bottling from a vineyard planted by three brothers who are longtime Salinas Valley farmers. The palate shows dark cranberry and raspberry, spiced up by chopped sage, thyme and bay leaf."
"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character."
"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel."
"Crisp, pristine peach and apricot notes resonate through the nose and palate of this fresh, blossomy dry Riesling. While zesty and lithe in body, ripe grapefruit and melon flavors feel supple and silky on the palate. Drink now through 2019."
"Smashed blackberry and blueberry fruit are enhanced by burned caramel, heavy slate and touches of soy and smoke on the nose. There's great depth in both body and flavors once sipped, with a layer of fine-grained tannins revealing teriyaki, black plum, boysenberry and touches of lavender."
"This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla."
"This bottling shows a rich, wood-aged wine, full of ripe yellow and tropical fruits as well as rich toasty flavors. The wine is warm, rounded, spicy and with its impressive structure still developing, it has the potential to age well. The wine is named to celebrate the second LanÃ§a generation in charge at the estate. Drink from 2017."
"From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish."
"Dark and thick in the glass, this wine shows strong but not bitter tar notes on the nose plus charred beef in a blueberry glaze, wet campfire, bourbon barrel and vanilla. The structure is massive now, gooey with thick tannins and flavors of espresso bean and condensed purple flowers. Judicious acidity ensures strong cellaring potential. Drink 2018â€“2027."
"Ripe aromas of raisin, black plum and horsehide are pointy and peppery. On the palate, this Graciano is bold and energetic, with lifting acidity. Loud berry flavors come with strong accents of dark chocolate and bitter espresso, while the finish is long but just moderate in complexity. Drink through 2020."
"Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness."
"Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power."
"From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine. It is firm, densely structured and with solid, dark tannins. There is a juicy black fruit background to this dense wine that gives a lift. Still young, this dark and very concentrated wine will be better from 2018."
"Baked plum, Asian spice, vanilla and menthol aromas carry the nose. The elegantly structured palate offers fleshy black cherry, licorice, mint and well-integrated French oak alongside fine-grained tannins that lend firm, polished support. A coffee note marks the finish."
"Intense aromas of ripe red berry, menthol, espresso and star anise lead the nose. The concentrated palate offers cranberry, dried Morello cherry, sage and licorice alongside close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink from 2018 through 2025."
"Low-yield vines on the best parcels of the Vincens estate are the source of this wine. It is super-rich and concentrated, maybe too much in its opulent excess. The wine does have great plum and berry flavors that are generous and full in the mouth. The wine even now is still young and will be better from 2018."
"A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper. Clove, allspice, and nutmeg arise immediately on the sip, backed by baked plum and bay leaf notes."
"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018â€“2034."
"Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature. It has smoky tannins that lie under the fine, elegant cherry and red plum fruits and acidity. The wine still has freshness although the attraction here is the ripe structure. The ornate label dates back to 1926."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020."
"Dry, briary aromas of field brush, black olive, herbs, berry fruits and saucy tomato are textbook Maipo. This is fresh, a touch choppy, and not overly heavy. Flavors of cassis, plum and vanilla carry over to the finish, which is fresh and bolstered by fine natural acidity. Drink through 2022."
"Of course, this 90% Tannat wine is still very young. But it's impressive, rich and concentrated and promises to age well. It is dense with both tannins and fruit, black plum and berry flavors dominating, cut by acidity. It will be ready to drink from 2019."
"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile."
"A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food. Rector Creek Vineyard is just north of Yountville and planted in rocky alluvial soils. Drink now through 2022."
"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table."
"Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines. It's invigorating and irresistably quaffable. The long, melon-rind finish is lip smacking."
"Just a touch of honey-lemon sweetness is enough to make this zesty, citrus-focused Riesling lip smackingly delicious. Fresh, green herb and lime notes reverberate through a strong finish. Drinks well now but should meld nicely over the next five years."
"Dry, spicy aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and berry fruits come together nicely. This Maule Valley Cab is fresh and harmonious across the palate, with nothing too pushy. Complex, balsamic flavors of olives, herbs, dried berries, turned earth and cocoa finish dry, peppery and elegant. Drink through 2019."
"This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish."
"The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors. It's plump and round, yet finishes fresh. Good as an apÃ©ritif or with light dishes."
"Crisp and fresh with enduring aromas of tomato leaf, citrus, pink grapefruit and white stone, this is textbook Sauvignon from the mountainous Alto Adige region of Italy. Pair it with appetizers or lightly spicy foods."
"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made."
"This Chianti Classico strikes a beautiful balance between elegance and intensity. It has both and its pretty aromas of wild berry, rose, ginger, anise and spice come forth in a continuous, steady manner. It feels bright and lively in the mouth and ends with a touch of piquant spice."
"Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit."
"The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine. The flavors are of fresh apricots, edged with green apples and pink grapefruit, a combination that shows both richness and great freshness. The finish is a reminder of the fine acidity in 2006."
"This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you."
"Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak."
"Loaded with bold, ripe fruit, exotic spice and leather, this is a simple but genuine expression of Brunello di Montalcino. The wine tastes thick and a bit chunky in the mouth because of its chewy, succulent tannins."
"With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a TorrontÃ©s that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that TorrontÃ©s should be. Drink now."
"This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now."
"Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice. A good example of elevated CarmenÃ¨re (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg."
"This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit. It just explodes with delicious cherry jam, red currant, licorice and mocha flavors. Dry and crisply acidic, it's a beautiful wine for early drinking."
"This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and hugeâ€”almost too muchâ€”emphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot."
"Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots, and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile, this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated, but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth, with spice, plum, blackberry and herb notes, particularly anise. Finishes clean, smooth and peppery. Drink now."
"Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range, with flavors of apple cider, citrus and some pith. Overall this is a good value wine with enough citrus and acidity to qualify it as fresh."
"Chocolate, espresso, plum and black currant are backed by smoky nuances and natural rubber. This muscular wine offers polished tannins and firm structure to the end. A bit of wine from the 2005 and 2006 vintages is blended in."
"From the little-known region of Padthaway, this Cabernet starts off with some very promising, perfumed aromas of mint and cassis, but then shows touches of chocolate and raisined fruit on the palate. It's soft and mouthfillingâ€”an easy-drinking Cab to consume on the young side."
"Here's an interesting blend of Corvina, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rondinella that reflects the aromas and power of each grape variety. The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent."
"A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap."
"Here's a traditional Chianti Classico with pretty aromas of cherry cola, mesquite, almonds and violets. The wine is compact and elegant in the mouth and offers crisp berry flavors on the close."
"This is a mature, jammy wine with thick layers of plum, prune and raisin. The wine's appearance is dark and concentrated and that same sensation of heaviness carries over the palate in the form of black currant and spice. The tannins are firm and tart."
"Pancole is a pretty expression of Tuscany's popular Vernaccia di San Gimignano with a luminous, bright appearance and pristine aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is lean and tonic with spicy notes on the finish."
"This is a concentrated, fairly full and lush Chenin, rich in toasty oak and vanilla cream as well as notes of baked apple pie and sweet orange. The medium-weight palate is mouthfilling and satisfying, with ample acidity to lift the decadent flavors. Notes of clove, anise and toasted nuts mingle on the lingering finish. Drink nowâ€“2019."
"This is a soft, well-crafted wine from the eastern side of St. Helena that's both classic in its dried herb, tobacco and tea aromas and fruity with red currant and cranberry notes."
"This is a beatifully balanced, not-too-full-bodied wine from vines grown at 2,400 feet in the Sierra range. It has classic black cherry, black olive and anise aromas, harmonious fruit flavors accented with light oak spiciness and a firm, fine-grained tannic structure."
"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, tobacco and dark spice lead the way. The rounded palate offers dried cherry, raspberry, coffee and a licorice note alongside velvety if not very persistent tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, this is evolving quickly so enjoy over the next several years."
"Made with 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this boasts appealing aromas of acacia flower, nectarine and Alpine herb. The elegant palate delivers juicy Gala apple, yellow peach and a touch of ginger alongside fresh acidity."
"This wine features pleasing aromas of raspberry, jumper berry and black pepper. There is a nice mÃ©lange of fruit and spice flavors, notably black cherry, dark plums, anise, and cardamom. Smooth tannins ply the palate right into a bright finish that bears a touch of salinity."
"A year in wood and 30 months in bottle before release have allowed this attractive wine to fully develop its solid yet smooth texture. It has concentration, layers of bright black currant fruit and vibrant acidity. Ready to drink."
"This bottling belongs to a series of wines from the legendary Jerry Lohr emphasizing RhÃ´ne varieties. It shows candied blackberry, violets and potpourri on the fruity, flowery and inviting nose. The palate leads with savory black pepper, which accents its core of black plum, blackberry and purple flower flavors."
"Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish."
"This is an extraordiary deal for a solidly built, high-level wine. It offers succulent cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors, wrapped in approachable, mellowed tannin and oak."
"Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice."
"A stony, flinty character leads the nose of this blend of 54% Sauvignon Blanc and 46% SÃ©millon, followed by scents of ripe peach, nectarine, freshly dried grass and herbs. The medium-weight palate offers more clean fruit flavors that result in a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Ample acidity lends freshness to the finish, alongside a lingering yellow flower character. Drink nowâ€“2019."
"Intriguing, thought provoking and complex, this wine starts off with perfumed aromas of thyme, bay leaf and lavender. It's supple in the mouth and silky in feel, imbued with black cherry and blueberry fruit, then shows a hint of adhesive bandage on the finish. Drink now."
"This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom. Those notes carry through to the medium-weight palate, well integrated with soft toasted-oak tones. It's harmonious and balanced, with ample acidity lending good lift through the close. Drink now."
"This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020â€“2025."
"Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so. This barrel-fermented Verdejo feels plump and chunky, with balancing acidity. Salty melon, apricot and apple flavors end steady and long. For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile."
"This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crÃ¨me de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate."
"This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone."
"Aromas of blackberry, fennel bulb and smoke set the scene for flavors of cherry, raspberry, chocolate and tobacco leaf. Mellow but ever-apparent tannins ply the palate alongside a strong bolt of acidity that tapers off into a pomegranate-imbued finish."
"Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019â€“2025."
"Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper. With ripe tannins and crisp acidity, it can easily age another year. Drink from 2018."
"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% SÃ©millon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard."
"From a vineyard in Northern Tokaj this dry Furmint has aromas of citrus pith and freshly cut pineapple. In the mouth, there are delightful flavors of grapefruit juice and white peach before the pleasantly acidic finish."
"Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity."
"This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance."
"Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018â€“2023."
"Bright and creamy, this savory white offers aromas and flavors of ripe apple, Bartlett pear, Alpine herb and a citrus note. Fresh acidity and a mineral vein energize the finish."
"Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well."
"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now."
"This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah. Smooth and lush in feel, ripe peach and tropical tones drive the palate, while hints of honeysuckle and baking spice unfold on the finish. Ample acidity keeps the wine's weight in check. Drink now."
"The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar."
"A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now."
"Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern RhÃ´ne wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors."
"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this GewÃ¼rtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry."
"Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now."
Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.
"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne."
"Neutral and unassuming on first impact, this luminous rosÃ© eventually delivers notes of mineral, ash, stone fruit and small berry. The wine offers more in the mouth, however, where it exhibits fresh flavors of raspberry and blueberry."
"Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper."
"Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both."
"The wine boasts a beautiful appearance thanks to its saturated golden color and faint amber highlights. It has a very fragrant nose and offers honey, peach and soapy floral notes. In the mouth, the wine delivers sweet fruit and a soft, silky texture."
"The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped downâ€”big and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes."
"A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now."
"Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap."
"Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese."
"Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture."
"This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. Though an earlier release might have allowed more primary fruit to show through, the wine offers easygoing but elegant enjoyment."
"Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish. Not much complexity but good fruit and depth. Not the least bit hard to drink. Good mass wine."
"Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon."
"Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now."
"Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now."
"This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice."
"Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors."
"Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now."
"Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavorsâ€”tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins."
"Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins. But the wine is too sweet and candied in the finish. Drink now."
"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish."
"The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness."
"Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal."
"A good value, this is an easy-pleasing Syrah with vibrant notes of red plum, cherry and blueberry. Fine, dusty tannins reminiscent of cocoa powder and dried crushed berries stay after swallow alongside a hint of sweet smoke flavor."
"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced."
"This wine strikes a superb balance between herbaceous, green notes and ripe black fruit, all graced with a kiss of sweet vanilla. Rich blackberry and cassis flavors flood the palate, but then transition to sweet smoke and oak flavors on the finish."
"Tannic yet balanced wine with a great swathe of perfumed fruit as well as dense black flavors. There is a herbal character as well as dark plum and sweet fruit flavors. Age for 2â€“3 years, the wine will always be firm."
"Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment."
"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas. Feels a bit clampy and tannic, with oaky, herbal flavors of plum and sweet berry. Shows a hint of green and drying tannins on the finish."
"Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit."
"A very good Pinot Noir, rich in cherry, licorice, cola and spice flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. It's on the forward side, trading complexity and nuance in favor of immediate gratification. Drink nowâ€“2014."
"A good amount of earthy spice, tea leaves and forrest floor lead the way on the nose, but the black cherry and berry fruit aromas follow shortly after with an additional accent of sweet cured meat. Medium weight and lush, the creamy mouth transitions into a finish loaded with sweet spice and bittersweet cocoa."
"Fairly intense and flavorful, this Chard expresses assertive aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, buttercream frosting, lemon custard and toasted brioche. Medium weight in the mouth with good balance and a touch of baking spice on the close."
"For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot."
"This vineyard-designate blend of Trebbiano and Grechetto opens with a luminous golden color and elegant aromas of stone fruit, citrus, Golden Delicious apple and mature pear. There's a pretty hint of vanilla and almond butter at the back."
"This sophisticated white wine from the homeland of Italy's most robust reds (Ripasso and Amarone) shows a full, generous appearance with a golden-amber color. Stone fruit, toasted almond and candied lemon give it heft and consistency."
"Smooth and ripe, this is a rich black-fruited wine, its tannins comfortably ensconsed in a rich cushion. There is acidity to balance and spice which, along with the full-bodied fruit character, makes the wine ready to drink now."
"A gorgeous expression of Friulano, this wine (in a screwcap bottle) makes an elegant addition to chicken, pasta or seafood dinners. Layers of peach, almond and pineapple are wrapped tightly together."
"Lively aromas of lemon, grapefruit and melon start this white from Greece. Flavors of grapefruit and lemon rind are fresh and crisp but still offer dimension. The finish is spicy and clean. A great food wine: pair with grilled fish or clams."
"This partially oak-aged expression of Pinot Bianco from cool-climate Alto Adige (in the far north of Italy) offers a lovely texture that is creamy and smooth at the same time. Measured aromas include melon, apricot, grapefruit and a touch of vanilla spice."
"Leather, berry, earth, raisin and roasted qualities define the nose on this Tempranillo-led blend of four grapes. Feels good in the mouth, with active raspberry, plum and coffee flavors that comes with a roasted accent. Mildly leafy, baked and woody on the thorough finish."
"This is a gorgeous Italian white from northern Italy that boasts fragrant tones of spring flower and chopped herb backed by peach, honey and white almond. It's crisp, intense and would be perfect with basil Thai curry."
"A medium-weight Cabernet with plum, prune, tobacco and herb aromas. Features average weight and body, with a creamy texture and layered flavors of black fruit, raspberry and spice. Finishes with herb and plum notes as well as a pinch of tobacco."
"A huge, kick butt Zinfandel, packed with sweet berry, bacon, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors. There's absolutely nothing shy about it. Packs a real punch all the way through to the spicy finish. Good price for a Sonoma Zin this classic."
"Quite a good Cabernet, showing the elegance and ripe fruitiness you expect from Napa, in a style for drinking now. Drily tannic, it shows classic blackberry and blueberry flavors."
"Fruity, forward and quite refreshing, this has appealing black cherry fruit with a light candy flavor. The balancing tannins add sufficient depth and weight to allow this a few more years in the cellar."
"This oak-fermented Sauvignon (in an artsy, screwcap bottle) delivers a rich, spicy finish and thick layers of peach, citrus, tomato leaf and honey-like aromas. It's a gorgeous wine that is an absolute pleasure to drink."
"A strongly spicy, rich wine, this has great concentration and an intense, dense texture.There is weight with plenty of ripe tropical fruits to contrast pronounced black pepper and bitter almond character. It's still young, so don't drink before 2015. Screwcap."
"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years."
"This delicious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with an intense, brooding fragrance of dark fruit, spice and leather. The palate delivers a concentrated black-cherry flavor that's framed by big, chewy tannins and  punctuated by spicy accents of white and black pepper, licorice and pipe. Drink 2015â€“2024."
"Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels."
"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later."
"This is a very aromatic wine that's rich, spicy and with just a touch of ripeness. It has spiced pear, lychee and honey notes all balanced by a wonderful fresh acidity. Drink now and until 2020. Screwcap."
"While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future. Give it 6â€“8 years to evolve in the bottle for further complexity."
"This is the stud in the AcÃºstic stable. A blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Garnacha, BraÃ³ is lively and bright on the nose, with ripe blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is concentrated and juicy, with fine balance and bold flavors of blueberry, blackberry and coffee. A toasty, dark finish features chocolate, toast and minerality. Drink through 2019."
"While it feels rich and round, this is also a wine with a crisp side to it. Acidity cuts through ripe pear, apricot and lychee flavors, giving a decidedly crisp balance. It's a wine that is already ready to drink. Screwcap."
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is so rich and decadent, with milk chocolate, blackberry and new French oak flavors. Made by celebrity winemaker Philippe Melka, it's soft and approacheable on the palate and widely appealing. Your best bet is to drink up now."
"This is a wine that has great potentialâ€”you can tell from the firm tannins, tight acidity and closed texture. Initially, black currant flavors are touched with dark, dusty notes, but they finish with more juicy character on the afterntaste. Drink from 2017."
"This powerful Sagrantino opens with aromas of meat juice, truffle and black fruit. The palate offers blackberry, black cherry, cinnamon and black pepper, along with tobacco notes. It also has Sagrantino's trademark tannic backbone, but the tannins are ripe and are balanced by bright acidity."
"Rich almonds, ripe peaches and a smoky, oxidized character all come together in this ripe, complex, fascinating wine. There is a great tang of apple acidity on the finish. Drink now."
"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020."
"Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020."
"This blend showcases the soft lusciousness and ripe fruit of Paso Robles. It's rich and sweet in jammy blackberries, cherries, chocolate and spicy sandalwood. Drink now."
"Rooty and leafy on the nose, with red berry aromas peeking through some obvious oak. The palate offers cherry and raspberry flavors along with sweetness, and things are backed by vanilla and chocolate. Good, tasty and oaky, with proper layering."
"This is a soft, gentle Cabernet for drinking now. It's pleasantly rich, offering blackberry, cherry, chocolate and cedar flavors, wrapped into easy tannins."
"Foresty and dark on the bouquet, with aromas of licorice, prune, forest and foxiness. The palate is full and tannic, while flavors run sweet, creamy and slightly syrupy, with chocolate and spiced fig notes. Finishes rich and rough, with dry herbs and true Chilean Cab flavors of olive and oregano."
"Pinay is a tight and defined red blend from northern Italy with bright accents of cherry cola, forest berry, licorice and dark mineral. There's a sharp, sour note on the close that would pair with smoked cheese."
"Soft, light in body and easy to drink, this Sangiovese, from the Napa estate vineyard, is delicious in raspberry, red currant, licorice, bacon and spice flavors. It's somewhat ephemeral, an instantly pleasant wine to drink especially with cured meats, olives, hard cheeses."
"A good, clean, tart and lightly spicy all-stainless style. Cool climate fruit puts the accent on lime and lemon flavors, keeps the alcohol low (13.3%), and makes this a fine match to shellfish, white fish and light pasta dishes."
"This fresh Nebbiolo-based Roero from Cantina dei Nebbiolo offers pretty intensity with aromas of tar, licorice and a touch of sweet cherry liqueur. There isn't much pulp or meat here but the finish is both crisp and tart."
"Slightly disjointed at first, this Barolo with fruit sourced from four vineyard sites, needs a few minutes to open in the glass. The wine offers tertiary aromas of cured beef, smoked bacon and white mushroom. Drink now."
This aged expression from the Nizza subzone of Asti offers tertiary aromas of dried tobacco and dried prune. The variety's characteristic acidity kicks in on the finish.
"Muted at first, this wine opens up nicely with time. Sweet, ripe and easy on the finish, its core is full of black pepper and clove. The grapes are sourced from several distinctive vineyards in Mendocino County. Drink it with a steak."
"Fragrant on the nose with fresh orange, lemon and honeysuckle aromas, this full-bodied Chard is deliciously quaffable with a concentrated apple palate and just a hint of buttered toast. Another well-made Romanian at an unbeatable bargain price."
"Rich and full in the mouth, packed with red fruits and black cherries. The wine is sweet, while keeping a tannic core. Drink next year."
"This fuller-bodied white blend offers pineapple, kiwi and citrus on the nose, and a blend of full fruit and acidity on the palate. A balanced, easygoing white that is perfect for everyday poultry, vegetable and fish meals."
Here's a fun and slightly less formal expression of Nebbiolo (especially when compared to the great wines of Barbaresco and Barolo) that offers tight fruit nuances of white cherry and forest berry backed by light shadings of spice and smoke.
"Aged 12 months in large oak casks, this bright Nebbiolo offers pretty aromas of small berry, tar, licorice and cigar smoke backed by tight intensity and structure. Pair this powerful wine with braised quail or pork tenderloin."
"This wine is light in color, but still packs a mouthful of flavor. It's peppery and meaty upfront, filled out on the midpalate by tart fruit that verges on cranberry in flavor. Pretty rather than potent; drink now-2014."
"A good wine to drink now for its sweet, ripe berry and mocha flavors and smoky coat of oak. It has smooth tannins and a spicy finish. Give it a good decant to let it breathe for a few hours."
"Roero Rabino is accented by sweet touches of cinnamon and nutmeg that are offset by cassis, dried blueberry, leather and tobacco. This sturdy red wine presents a very nice ensemble that is capped by a tight, astringent close."
"With rich, sweet blackberry and cocoa flavors, this is a very nice Cabernet for drinking with a good meal. It's a little rough around the edges, with jaggy tannins. Ready now."
"Honey, almond blossom and citrus zest are followed by creamy foam and tonic acidity. This is an easygoing Prosecco that offers a light and compact structure and bright flavors of lime and green fruit."
"An intriguing blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle, which highlights the herbaceous Sauvignon character and a more perfumed Muscadelle. The two give a fresh, citrus- and pineapple-flavored wine, lively, to be enjoyed young."
"Soft, ripe, dominated by peaches, pears and a rounded, toasty character. The spice is dominant, giving the wine an exotic edge. The more rounded style gives concentration as well as a fine, finishing velvet texture."
"Fiery and wild at first, with aromas of cinnamon, pepper and Juicy Fruit gum. Strange as that may sound, the wine finds a more familiar place on the palate, where plum, cherry and cassis flavors are flashy and the feel is a bit clangy. Rounds out with air and settles down fairly nicely."
"Paladin produces a luminous and fresh Prosecco from the northeast of Italy with tonic aromas of peach, white stone and citrus fruit. It's an easy-drinking wine that would wash down well with appetizers and informal finger foods."
Soapy aromas of bee's wax and lavender open the nose of this luminous sparkler and are followed by dried flowers and hay. There are peach-like flavors with aftertastes of green melon and lime. Grapes are grown organically and according to biodynamic principles.
This Brut interpretation of Prosecco (â€œBrutâ€ means it tastes dry in the mouth) offers tangy fizz and soda-like intensity backed by subdued aromas of white mineral and stone fruit. Pair it with puff pastry appetizers.
"This is a â€œdryâ€ vintage Prosecco with a hint of sweetness in the mouth that is surrounded by fragrant flavors of peach, kiwi and green melon. This luminous sparkler tastes firm and tonic and makes for an informal afternoon sipper."
"Mildly minty and woody on the nose, with grass, wintergreen and cheese aromas as well as red fruit. The palate is tight and grabby, with a blast of citric acid that gives the plum and raspberry flavors a tart, decidedly â€œredâ€ personality. Snappy and crisp on the finish, making it a fresh, lean style of Cabernet."
The wine's golden hue tells you this is Prosecco from a warmer climate (Conegliano is a few degrees warmer than Valdobbiadene) as do its aromas of mature peach and honeysuckle. The wine tastes flat and big in the mouth and offers sophisticated notes of white pepper and spice.
"This white has a light, delicate nose of citrus and apricot. On the palate it's smooth and balanced with lush apricot and spice flavors. A touch of acidity gives the wine lift. A lingering finish adds to its poise. Pair with a creamy cheese or sip alone."
Drying mineral tones face off with luscious peach flavors to create a well-balanced Extra Dry Prosecco sparkler. The bubbly offers cheerful foaming in the mouth and sweet fruit flavors on the close.
"Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers, while the palate is more vivacious and tangy, with flavors of orange, tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine, but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content. Probably good with salads and seafood."
"This New World blend of Sauvignon Blanc, SÃ©millon, Chardonnay and Viognier is very fruity. It offers a blast of pineapples, honeysuckles, peaches and figs, with a coating of oaky, vanilla buttercream."
"With a fruity-sugary finish, this Zin will appeal to folks who like their red wines a little on the sweet side. It has pleasantly ripe flavors of black cherries, raspberries, red currants, root beer, mocha and pepper."
"This RhÃ´ne-style blend is a little rustic and sharp in tannins and acids. It shows a polished core of jammy blackberries, cherries and spices, and could develop in a year or two."
"Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean GewÃ¼rztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads."
"This Prosecco Brut from the slightly warmer Conegliano subzone is a perfect example of its kind. The luminous sparkler offers drying mineral tones that are embellished by pretty notes of white rose, honey, stone fruit and citrus. The mouthfeel is lean, smooth and fresh."
This crisp sparkler is characterized by drying mineral tones and delicate aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The wine is foamy and slightly sweet in the mouth and does an excellent job of representing this category of Italian wine.
"A ripe, fruity wine that takes its raspberry flavor from the color. The wine has softness, a creamy character that rounds out any acidity, leaving a smooth, fruity finish."
"There's a unique note here of mature fruit, chopped basil or peppermint with a hint of spice or chopped white peppercorn. The bubbling seems less frothy and the wine has a flat, big feel in the mouth. Grapes were farmed organically and the wine is from the 2007 vintage, which may explain its distinctive style."
"Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy, tannic palate. This tastes of burnt oak, raw plum and currant, while the finish tastes briny and harsh. The 2012 version of this wine was much better. This is rough from front to back."
"An easy and inviting selection, there's a mentholated streak to the soft red currant and cherry core of this wine. Light and breezy on the palate, it offers thin, quickly dissipating flavors and a fleeting finish."
The wine is earthy and somewhat rustic. There is fruit but it is spoiled by a spicy pepper edge. Chill this drastically.
"Red in color, with berry and apple aromas, this is sweet, with a heavy body and light effervescence."
"The nose is muted, despite the slight spritz of the wine, while the palate is equally toned down. It's a rounded if not very expressive white wine."
"Plummy and hinting at black cherry, this wine is otherwise soft and simple, with a distracting, full-throttled descent into raisin cake and prune."
"Funky, yeasty aromas of cinnamon, spent lees and bread yeast dominate the nose. This feels foamy, with lightly vegetal flavors of apple that finish briny."
"Jumpy on the nose at first, but then green tea and grassy aromas take over. This PN is what it is: it tastes grassy, leafy and like green beans. Vegetal notes carry over to the finish."
"Aromas of pumpkin, squash and corn chips are stale and not inviting. There's an acceptable mouthfeel to this weird, unbalanced Chardonnay along with flavors of spiced squash, mealy apple and sautÃ©ed root vegetables."
"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish."
"This deep brown wine smells like a damp, mossy cave. Then add complex rancio notes, plus maple syrup and molasses. It's full, round and harmonious, wonderfully rich yet without any sense of heaviness and long and bright on the finish."
"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach."
"Deep mahogany. Dried fig and black tea on the nose, then concentrated mocha and molasses flavors, enlivened by candied orange zest. Full, rich and sweet, but surprisingly drinkable, with terrific intensity and length."
"RunRig is always complex, and the 2012 doesn't disappoint in that regard, mixing bacony-meaty notes with hints of black olives and ripe plums. The tannins are supremely supple, but the acids are crisp, resulting in a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink nowâ€“2030."
"After a few minutes in the glass, this stunning wine opens up to reveal classic Nebbiolo aromas of leather, tilled soil, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and ripe berry. The juicy concentrated palate dishes out layers of succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise and pipe tobacco framed in firm, velvety tannins. Drink 2022â€“2035."
"This amber-colored Hungarian stunner has ethereal aromas of raw honey, beeswax, freshly baked tarte Tatin, canned apricot and fresh pear. It is silky smooth and creamy in the mouth with pronounced flavors of clover honey, pear tart and baked sweet apples. The acidity is perfectly balanced so you can appreciate its velvety richness without feeling that the sweetness is too cloying."
"Citrus-kissed saltiness lies at the core of this incredibly delicious, deliriously crafted wine, from the great grape grower in the heart of the Russian River Valley. Beautifully crisp, it lingers in stony minerality and a freshness of apricot, memorable from first sip to last."
"This beautiful, rich wine has yellow fruits and is concentrated, tightly textured and conveys a ripe character. The touches of wood are just right, adding spice to the opulent fruitiness. A mineral texture gives some tightness to the aftertaste. Drink from 2024."
"Whiffs of white mushroom, saffron and caramel lend complexity to this concentrated elixir of apricots and orange peels. It's honeyed and sweet but vivaciously balanced, glazing the palate in ethereal textures of gossamer and tulle. The caramel finish lingers endlessly."
"A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time."
"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines. Mocha, licorice and blackberries feature on the nose, while the palate delivers more of the sameâ€”dark fruit, chocolate and plenty of spice. Best after 2020."
"Produced from vines more than 100 years old in the heart of the Clos de Vougeot vineyard, this is an impressive wine with a long future. The wood aging is already surrounded by ripe, intense black fruits. A fresher character comes from the bright acidity of the vintage, giving the wine a lift. The aftertaste is long and concentrated. Drink from 2024."
"Intensely fragrant, this honey-sweet auslese wafts of ripe yellow peaches and caramelized sugar. Tropical mango, pineapple and melon collide on the palate before falling neatly in line against a strike of high-toned acidity. The finish is luxuriously long, peppered by a faint dusting of saffron. It's a stunner already but should shine brightly for decades to come."
"Up the slope above the Grand Cru of Le Montrachet, this vineyard once grew hemp (hence the name, cheneve). This poised wine is both stylish and rich, with good acidity allied to ripe apple and citrus fruits, cut through the mineral texture and promise a generous wine as it ages. Drink from 2020."
"Bacon and tapenade elements merge easily on the nose, followed by a wine that's full bodied and creamy textured on the palate. This is dark and meaty in profile, yet not heavy or cooked, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink nowâ€“2030."
"Enticing scents of ripe berry, underbrush, grilled herb and eucalyptus mingle together along with an underlying fragrance of rose petal. Elegant and fresh, the impeccably balanced palate delivers tart red cherry, cake spice, white pepper and mineral nuances alongside polished tannins. Drink 2018â€“2028."
"As impressive as the womanâ€”a pioneer in the Napa Valleyâ€”was herself, this 100% varietal wine from the estate property high atop Diamond Mountain is powerfully elegant, intense yet refined. It begins with a high-toned, graceful entry that's rich in blueberry and chocolate, the oak smooth and integrated, with a suggestion of hand-rolled tobacco. Drink now through 2022."
"This is an opulent wine from one of the fabled series of white Grand Crus. Along with generous yellow fruits and ripe citrus, it has weight and gravitas. Spice from the wood fills things out even more, giving the wine its balance, its intensity and its future. Drink from 2022."
"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030."
"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oakyâ€”full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconutâ€”but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking nowâ€“2025."
"This spends 12 months in oak and it shows: It offers aromas of liquid smoke and flavors of brown sugar, honey and caramel. The fruit is subdued, leaving the emphasis on the oak and mineral components. Try with rich but delicately flavored fish dishes or mild chÃ¨vres."
"Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood. The finish is round, tasty and mouthfilling, while overall the wine seems to dance due to popping acidity. This is CarmenÃ¨re with a vital streak."
"A plump, juicy mouthful of citrusy fruit, worth trying with grilled or broiled seafood. The zesty lime aromas broaden out on the palate to include orange and tangerine flavors, making it tart but not too tart. Best Buy."
"This medium-weight wine flows effortlessly from start to finish, blending aromas of smoke and nuts with a citrusy core. Picks up savory nutty, cheesy notes (like a good GruyÃ¨re) on the long finish."
"Mint again, with earth and tobacco; one taster found traces of bell pepper. Coffee and brown sugar further soften a supple, mature mouthfeel. Drink now."
"Fragrant, aromatic, grassy aromas give way to fresh, crisp, green fruit and gooseberry flavors. Finishes lively and vibrant."
"A fresh, crisp style of Soave, brimming with green plum and light acidity. It has concentration and a light touch in equal measure."
"Crisp, green, grassy wine with fresh acidity and herbeceous character. It is very New World with its tropical flavors and open, forward fruit."
"An irresistibly drinkable white wine, filled with the juiciest flavors of citrus fruits, fig, melon and peach, and just the tiniest bit sweet. Crisp acidity cleanses the palate and leaves it feeling minty fresh on the long, spicy finish."
"A soft, ripe wine that manages to showcase tobacco, earth and black cherry flavors in a relatively lightweight format, finishing long and tart."
"A well-judged, well-structured wine that balances fresh, crisp and light fruit against flavors of peaches, almonds and cinnamon. It will be better in two or three years' time."
"A fresh, tangy, vibrant wine that has ripe green plum and apple flavors alongside a layer of full, forward fruit."
"The color is appropriately light, the aromas appropriately floral and rose-like. Fleshy cherry flavors are balanced by a helping of greens and flowers. Light and elegant. Who would've thought Nebbiolo like this could come from Mexico?"
"This blend of Chardonnay, Nosiola and Pinot Bianco offers up apples and cream on the nose, along with flavors of peach and citrus. It's a comfortable mix of fruit that finishes lively and fresh, making it a fine apÃ©ritif."
"At first this is aggressive, with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big, but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion."
It's testament to this wine's balance that it remains so alive and fresh long after many other Biancos have faded. Intensely mineral aromas mix with notes of smoke and fresh apples; the flavors are earthy and hint at mineral oil. Long on the finish. Best Buy.
"With its herbal, traditional aromas, this New World Cabernet could impersonate and Old World model. The palate is tight and firm, with lively tannins and bracing acids. The flavors run toward plum and chocolate, and there's a bitter hint on the back palate. The finish is plummy and dark."
"This lovely Chardonnay has just the right blend of juicy peaches and subtle herbs and flowers to make it easy to drink, yet interesting enough to hold your attention. Finishes long and mouthwatering."
"Aromas of roses, pepper and spices make this an enticing wine. On the palate, it is ripe, soft, full-bodied and rich, lacking acidity, but otherwise classic GewÃ¼rztraminer."
"Richly textured, viscous but with good acidty for balance. The wine shows pretty melon, citrus, herb, grass, peach and spice flavors and features a mineral edge that is fresh and clean at the end."
"A first-rate wine, with well-ripened flavors of blackberries, espresso, cola, tea, and bitter chocolate, but made more interesting by fresh acidity not often seen in today's better Merlots. This cool-climate wine also has sturdy tannins that suggest mid-term aging."
"A great and versatile food wine. Its polished flavors of lime, fig and apricot are drizzled with Oriental spices and smoky oak. One of California's  most consistent wines, and rich enough to stand in for Chardonnay."
"Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry. Bone dry with excellent acidity, this somewhat tart wine is well made, and may be an ager."
"A blend of grapes, so maybe it is not surprising that the aromas and flavors are a blend: melons, pears and limes, all presented with great freshness and verve alongside a rich texture. Editors' Choice."
"Right off the bat this wine is pure and smooth. The nose is pretty, with cranberry and cassis. Next up is a palate of pure red fruit and only a light shading of oak. The finish draws applause for its clarity and buttery nuances. It's what a good Chilean Cabernet should be; it's ripe and easy to drink, yet fairly solid and impressive. Best Buy."
"With full oak and pineapple aromas along with a big mouthful of spicy apple and pear fruit, this is no weakling. On the contrary, it's full and meaty, with a lot of texture and extract. The feel is healthy even if the acidity is on the low side. A very good wine to drink now; it probably won't age that well."
"A lovely wine, made even more attractive by the value price. It has flavors and lemons and limes and a ripe, sweet edge of honey, although it's technically dry. The acidity is clean and refreshing."
"Strongly oaked, but fresh, young and healthy in the nose. The smell of coconut and lemon curd is friendly and soft, while the palate is loaded with more lemon, coconut, pear and nutmeg. The texture is rich, and, for now, the acidity is bright. A solid Chardonnay for current drinking."
"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now."
"This is the first vintage of this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc, named after the 16th-century abbess Rylint Formentini. Peppery in character, with rich, complex fruit, it has citric flavors, along with a sense of structure and acidity."
"Rich in spicy, briary berry-cherry and chocolate fruit, with ultra-smooth tannins, and just enough acidity to cut through barbecue sauce. It's a bit sweet and Porty on its own."
"Fresh aromas of red cherry and light berry fruit precede a palate that runs a little racy, with borderline tart plum and pie cherry flavors. A solid mouthfeel and mild, chalky tannins give it presence, and for sure it's a clean, sturdy wine. But that's really as far as it goes."
"On the plump but balanced side, with a perfumed nose that's almost sweet for SB. In the mouth, it's fairly lively and lifted, with nectarine and melon flavors that morph into pink grapefruit on the finish. Decent quality; will get the job done."
"The wine starts off slowly due to a note of almond nut or cardboard that masks the natural fruit. Once it gets started, however, this luminous sparkling Prosecco offers cheerful notes of stone fruit and pear."
"Tonic and lean with a nearly transparent color and lively perlage, this non-DOC Prosecco offers candy-like aromas of butterscotch and lemon soda. There's an interesting touch of crushed white peppercorn in there as well and this well-priced wine would make a perfect match to appetizers and finger foods."
"This Extra Dry (slightly sweet) vintage Prosecco delivers a lean, slightly watery style and piquant bubbles that recall lemon soda. The wine is firm and steely in the mouth with tonic bubbling and layers of fresh fruit on the close."
"Formerly doing business as â€œShiraz,â€ this Syrah from Bisquertt offers a huge purple tint, roasted aromas of blackberry and campfire, and a ripe, grapey palate that brims with simple, racy black cherry, pepper and other driving flavors. Not timid by any means but also nothing out of the ordinary."
"Dry and acidic, this light-bodied wine has tart flavors of mashed cherries, cherryskins, orange zest and citrus fruits. It's a Bordeaux blend with Zinfandel and Sangiovese. Nice with pizza with prosciutto and olives."
"Smells funky, with sweaty leather aromas, although you'll also find varietal notes of the grape. Tastes all right, with blackberries, currants, leather and mocha that are wrapped into firm tannins."
"Citrus tones, peach, white flower and mineral notes come forward thanks to the wine's bright personality and zesty effervescence. There are soft notes of crushed pepper and loads of sweet stone fruit flavors to enjoy as well."
"A creamy, caramel- and pear-flavored wine, keeping freshness but enriched with an almond and custard tart finish."
"Aromas of baked apple, nut oil and toast are mildly appealing, while the round, dry palate is home to flavors of melon and bitter pith. The finish of peach pit and citrus peel is par for the course, and overall it's time to get at this standard Chardonnay before it goes flaccid."
"This Prosecco delivers medium intensity and a compact, slightly watery mouthfeel followed by lime, kiwi, white flower, honey and chopped basil. The cheerful sparkler ends with creamy consistency thanks to the foamy quality of its effervescence."
"Fresh and delicate with floral and citrus overtones, this wine has an elegant character. Its dry, spicy flavors are subtle and refreshing, giving the wine food pairing flexibility. Ideally, though, think of spicy cuisine like Indian, Thai or Indonesian."
"An elegant nose of violet and blackberry gives this Cab Franc a graceful start. On the palate, soft cherry and blackberry flavors are punctuated by spice and pepper. An interesting sip that will pair well with fowl, beef."
"A nice Cabernet for this everyday price. Dry and smooth, it shows interesting flavors of black currants, plums, herbs and spice, with a touch of smoky oak."
"Canah Brut Prosecco exhibits a slightly more saturated golden color and intense notes of mature peach, dried apricot with delicate mineral tones in the background. This rich sparkler is fatter and denser than most Proseccos and boasts an attractively low price tag."
"Here's an organically grown Prosecco with citrusy notes of lime and grapefruit backed by white mineral and orange blossom. The wine is firm and slightly sweet on the finish and offers an easy, no-fuss experience overall."
"Here's a Prosecco with a broad and far-reaching aspect to its aromatic profile that recalls roasted almonds, mature peach and yellow rose. There's a pungent note in there as well of ash or talc powder and the sparkler ends with a playful blast of piquant spice."
"Citrus and spice overtones dominate the nose of this elegant Riesling. On the palate, slightly sweet fruit flavors are balanced by mineral and spice. Pair with grilled seafood, salads and cheeses."
This is an easy-going Prosecco with lively tones of stone fruit and citrus. The wine is informal and tonic which makes it perfect as an appetizer wine or with friends on a lazy summer afternoon.
"This is a sweet style of Prosecco with a luminous appearance and grassy-herbal notes followed by white peach, honey and jasmine. More herbal flavors appear on the close and the wine is fresh and simple in the mouth."
"Using many biodynamic practices, Werner Michlits has crafted a rich, sweet and juicy wine, full of intense fruit, touched by spice, but more to do with black plum, fresh figs and vivid acidity. This is a hearty wine, ready to drink, its final tannins soft. Screwcap."
"A smooth, perfumed wine that has softened just in time for its fifth year. It has black-currant and berry fruits that are ripe while still showing fresh acidity. The tannic structure is there, well integrated into the polished structure. Drinkable now."
"This is the first of 15 estates the Gonfrier family owns throughout Bordeaux. There are strong wood influences here, although the fruit is enough to match up. So ripe pear and apricot flavors go with those toasty characters to give a rich, full-bodied wine. It will be better from late 2016."
"All varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from top sites Ciel du Cheval, Conner Lee, Obelisco and Stonetree. The aromas are quite reserved, with notes of barrel spice that are followed by full-bodied fruit flavors with a spicy finish. It drinks well but the variety seems lost."
"The light aromas suggest notes of star fruit and citrus. The palate is flavorful, with racy acids keeping the fruit in focus."
"There is a savory, fragrant, mossy greenness that draws you in. On the concentrated palate, this becomes more distinct as the peel of Bosc pear and crushed arugula emerge. Lime zestiness comes with a slightly warm finish."
"This wine is dry and rather full bodied, starting with fruity aromas like banana and coconut then seguing to more nutty, oaky, complex flavors and a rich texture. It's a serious dinner wine with heft and substance."
"Blossom and berry notes are accented by hints of smoked nut in this refreshingly light-bodied wine. Zesty and lithe on the palate, it's an ideal summer-to-fall apÃ©ritif or porch sipper. The moderately long finish is marked with a hint of waxy florals."
"Slightly foxy on the nose, with rubbery aromas of cherry and cassis, this offers a tight, tannic palate with hard, elastic tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are pleasant, while the finish is ripe, warming and healthy."
"A touch blossomy against a core of ripe raspberry and cherry perfume, the nose on this traditional-method Pinot Noir sparkler is particularly alluring. The palate is elegant and fresh, marked by fine, mouthfilling mousse and delicate raspberry-candy finish."
"An earthy hint colors the pear notes which on the palate acquire a fresh, almost floral quality. The earthy tone of yeast and miso provides a counterpoint to the zesty, lime-peel freshness. The finish is clean-cut and very refreshing."
"Aromas of coffee, barrel spice and dark-blue fruit lead to rich, full-bodied blackberry and spice flavors. It's not for the faint of heart but delivers a lot of enjoyment."
"Yellow pear, fresh-squeezed lime, light mint and wet-cement aromas show on the brisk nose of this bottling by veteran Adam Tolmach. A grippy texture and lively acidity frame the palate, where green apple and lime flavors show. It's clean, pure and easy."
"This Tempranillo-based pinkie is quite inviting and tightly textured, with aromas of orange shave ice, strawberry cream, watermelon and cement. It is extremely zesty and lively once sipped, offering easy-to-drink raspberry and melon notes. It's great for all sorts of food, from spicy to rich."
"The aromas of whole lime, flowers, jasmine and watermelon Jolly Rancher pop. It drinks off dry, with floral flavors that carry through the finish."
"Smoky aromas and a bold apricot flavor give this dry and seemingly light-bodied wine a distinct personality. Fermented in small concrete egg-shaped vats, it's far from simple and fruity, and instead offers great acidity and a tangy, tempting, appetizing personality."
"Coffee, toasted oak, coconut and raspberry confiture aromas lead the way. On the dense palate, dark chocolate, oak and licorice accent fleshy black cherry while fine-grained tannins provide support."
"Creamy notes pear crumble make for a most attractive nose. The palate follows with gentle softness and concentration, supported by bright, fresh acidity. The creamy notes continue alongside notes of green and red apple and fresh pear. There is a lot of substance and body, so have this alongside a meal, the finish is superclean."
"Aromas of apricot and white spring flower lift out of the glass. The apricot note follows through to the palate, along with yellow peach, honeydew melon and almond, all framed in bright acidity. This one closes on a flinty note."
"Blended from all five Bordeaux varieties, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot almost equal in proportion, this is a lovely, well-crafted wine, softly concentrated with highlights of licorice, lavender, violets and black pepper. From three ranches farmed by the family, it's both seamless and structured."
"Fresh, focused and tight on the nose, with an undertone of mild oak and earth, this gets going with ease. A fresh, fruity palate is just rugged enough, while flavors of black plum, cherry, licorice and herbs finish toasty, spicy and firm."
"Leathery berry and savory, smoky oak aromas are a rugged introduction to a stout palate with juicy acidity. Flavors of baked plum, hard spices, salt and savory herbs finish with rubbery tannins, energy and spicy, peppery flavors."
"This wine is a blend of fruit from five different vineyards scattered across the valley. The aromas of barrel spice, black cherry, dried leaves, herbs and flowers still seem quite locked up. The flavors are generous and full with palate coating milk chocolate and cherry flavors with a finish that lingers."
"Tender notes of red apple skin and bottled strawberries are pulled into focus by zesty citrus. The bone-dry palate reveals more bottled but wonderfully tart strawberry flavors and finishes in a very linear, refreshing and light-footed fashion."
"Voluptuous blackberry and plum flavors are edged by hints of bitter coffee and spice in this richly bodied wine. Fringed by a bare feather of tannins, it's luscious in mouthfeel, with an unctuousness that persists luxuriously on the palate."
"Berry crumble and licorice star in this full-bodied, hearty and smooth wine, blended with 4% Petite Sirah. Spicy oak and milk chocolate unleash further flavor and spice on the finish."
"Earthy, savory notes of yeast and miso swing alongside the green pear flavors. There is spice and concentration on the midpalate and some tingling pepper spice."
"Vibrant and savory, this has aromas of red berry, blue flower and a whiff of baking spice. The bright palate doles out red cherry, juicy strawberry, and star anise alongside bright acidity that gives it a crisp finish."
"Fresh blueberry and grape aromas meet with black plum, asphalt and turned earth on the nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley of Stephen Ross Cellars. Fresh blackberry juice, black pepper and dill show on the palate that is coated with decent acidity and a good tannic structure."
"The wine is initially soft with melon and ripe pear fruit. Behind this fruity exterior, there is a crisper citrus character that is bright and light. It's a ripe wine, all fruit with a tighter, mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
"This appealing blend of 50% Roussanne, 30% Grenache Blanc and 20% Clairette is tight and citrusy on the nose, broadening out on the palate to offer hints of apple, pineapple and underripe melon. Drink now."
"Aligi Sassu is a lovely sparkler without added sugar or liqueur. It offers a fragrance of white flower, lemon drop and nut. The palate delivers citrus, apple and almond flavors along with refined, persistent bubbles and a bone-dry finish."
"Now part of Jacquart Champagne, Montaudon produces sophisticated and elegant wines, as this Classe M shows. It is crisp and dry in style with citrus and grapefruit flavors dominating. but some bottle age adds texture and notes of toastiness."
"Here's an enticing Vino Nobile offering aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, ripe cherry and spice. The palate delivers succulent black cherry, plum, cinnamon and nutmeg along with velvety tannins. Although it shows the warmth of the vintage, it still retains elegance and class. Delicatio Wines, Golden Vines."
"Aromas of wood aging and ripe yellow fruits are a fine pairing for this wine that comes from the slopes above Meursault. With its textured character, apricot and peach flavors and tight acidity, this is a serious and complex wine that demands aging. Drink from 2015."
"This is a rich, bottle-aged wine is bright with lemon and green-apple fruitiness, but it's starting to develop secondary flavorsâ€”notes of toast, almonds and cookiesâ€”as well. It's at just the right stage of development and ready to drink now."
"An aromatic knockout with notes of peach, papaya, lychee and brown sugar. At 250 g/L of residual sugar, it's dense and rich with carmelized sugar flavors and a lengthy finish."
"Fine acidity and a bracing minerality, like a lick of cold steel on a winter day, mark this Chardonnay. It has oak notes, but they're wisely kept in the background, allowing the citrus, green apple and peach flavors to star. This beautiful wine continues the winery's string of great reserve Chardonnays, and is their best since the 2006 vintage."
"Thickly moussed, Roederer's Brut, 60% Chardonnay blended with 40% Pinot Noir, aged two years on yeast is affordable and luxurious. A gorgeous, very dry sparkling wine with aromatics of honey, raisin, apple and pear, it is rich and soft and offers both depth and length. It's an ideal marriage of bright acidity and ripe fruit character."
"With a wine this finely constructed, the question is always ageability. There's no question about the immediate deliciousness. It's thrilling with raspberries, strawberries, orange rind and cola, and complex notes of minerals and earth. The mouthfeel is absolutely beautiful, comprised of silk and satin brightened with acidity. So should you drink it now? Yes. Will it age? For the next six years, yes."
"From one of Franciacorta's leading producers, Gran CuvÃ©e Pas OperÃ© offers an enticing fragrance of acacia flower, white flowers and beeswax. The creamy palate delivers apple, nut, spice, thyme and sage along with fine, persistent effervescence."
"A rich, bottled-aged wine, full of toast as well as apple and crisp grapefruit flavors, this has great balance and elegance. It's full of fruit, but structured and seamlessly integrated. It's ready to drink now, but will also improve with age. Drink until 2020."
"Proving that exceptional wines can be (and were) made in this cool, light vintage, this estate-grown selection is both elegant and complex. Flavors of mixed wild berries, a streak of tea, a whiff of peach and compelling balance carry it through an extended finish."
"A marvelous Pinot Blanc, this combines aromatic hints of almond with mixed citrus fruit and rind, zippy acidity and a great wash of minerality. It cleanses and tickles the palate, lingering sensuously through a finish of surprising depth."
"This big, ripe and fruity wine shows both the richness and the structure of the vintage, but never loses sight of balance. It's full of rich yellow fruits, green plums and citrus, but structured with refreshing acidity, a minerally texture and gentle hints of wood aging. Drink from 2015."
"This is a beautiful wine showing remarkable richness and maturity. Hints of toast and bright fruits combine seamlessly to yield a full, ripe wine marked with with intense acidity. With concentration from old vines showing strongly, it's a wine that's ready to drink now."
"Richly textured and unabashedly full in body, this dry Riesling is intensely ripe. Pineapple and peach flavor is accented by zesty lime peel and earthy tones of wet stone and lanolin. The midpalate is lifted by a whiff of violet perfume and bold, lemon-lime acidity envigorates the finish."
"Morar is a spicy Amarone with a fragrance of raisin, baked plum, tobacco and black pepper. The palate delivers lush black cherry and raspberry flavors mingled with intense white pepper, clove and nutmeg notes. It's smooth and rich with enough freshness to make this a perfect match for seasoned cheeses or roasted red meat."
"Crisp and structured, this is an intensely mineral wine. It has great acidity and a strongly zesty, tangy character that still needs time to soften. It's bright, fruity and full of dancing freshness. It's good to go now, but keep until 2017 and it will be that much more complex."
"Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and brambleâ€”one almost wants to say thistleâ€”wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade."
"The nose of this powerfully fruity yet dry Riesling packs a punch, with aromas of ripe pineapple, apricot and floral potpourri. The palate is dense with stone fruit, and a hint of red berry flavor, but finishes elegantly with sleek mineral tones."
"Lanolin and honeycomb notes lend a minerally feel to rich, lusciously concentrated peach and tangerine flavors in this powerful yet finely structured kabinett. A hint of spritz and shocking lemon-lime acidity lead the way to a long, elegant finish."
"Very dry in style, this is a beautifully crisp, tight and taut Champagne. It has citrus and green apple flavors, and is steely in character while also fruity. It could do well with some more bottle age."
"Rich and opulent, this is a full-throated Pinot Noir. It has ripe berry flavors and a balancing acidity that supports a dense texture and underlay of firm tannins. While delicious now, this is a wine that will improve with aging so drink from 2016."
"This wine is ripe, rich and full in the mouth, like a fruit salad of red cherries, plums and berries. Yet there's a more solid sideâ€”rounded tannins support the concentrated fruits, and touches of wood aging broaden the feel of this impressive wine. Drink from 2017."
"A powerful wine, richly structured and full of ripe fruits. It has a solid feel to it, firmly anchored to its dark tannins as well as lightened by the juicy berry flavors. A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, it needs serious aging, so don't drink before 2017."
"Already mature, this is a rich and opulent wine that blends together toast and secondary-fruit aromas with fresh, lively acidity. It has weight and substantial depth and concentration. It should age well for another few years, but this impressive wine can be drunk now as well."
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was grown in the well-known Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard. It's at a funny stage of development, with primary cherry and blackberry fruit starting to fade, while sage, dill, green olive and dried fruit notes are emerging. The tannins remain robust, while the acidity is just about perfect for Napa Valley. Awkward now, but with a promising future, it should emerge from the doldrums after 2017."
"This is a big wine, clearly in need of cellaring. There's a massive core of blackberries, cherries and baking chocolate on the palate, but it's rigidly tannic, dry and acidic still. The blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, putting it in the super Tuscan category. Give it until 2017 to begin to mellow, and it could still be going strong in 2025."
"An interesting percentage of Cabernet Franc gives this wine a more perfumed character than is usual in many Pomerols. On the palate, the wine is rich and shows the aromatic character of the berry fruits and well integrated wood. It is young still, needing time. Drink from 2017."
"This is a superior vintage Champagne that is just beginning to mature. Crisp white and citrus fruits are beginning to fade into mature toast and cookie flavors, but the wine maintains its zesty texture. Drink this wine now, but beware the cork is secured precariously with string that must be cut to open."
"Garnet-ruby in color, this has fresh aromas of white cherry, plum, dried dill and rosemary. The mouthfeel is simple and clean, with fresh acidity on the close."
"This Stella Mae is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. It remains a rather lean wine in the Sparkman portfolio, despite having alcohol at 14.6%. Here are lightly earthy flavors of strawberry and herb, with a hint of green in the tannins."
"This pretty Cannonau-based wine opens with ripe aromas of blackberry, tobacco and dried spice. The mouthfeel is smooth, plush and dense."
"The alcohol is nice and low in this dry Pinot Noir. It has a silky texture and complex flavors of red cherries, persimmons, cola and spices. Acidity is great but there's something slightly off, suggesting a trace of unripeness. Drink now."
"A glimmer of toast and honey add depth to the green fig, apple and underripe peach center of this wine. Fresh and zippy on the palate, the vibrant fruit and sweet citrus flavors carry through to the mouthwatering finish. Drink up."
"A fresh and fruity wine that's ready to drink now. This has attractive aromas and flavors of green apple and lime followed by a clean, mouthwatering finish. There's a soft herbal streak that adds depth to the nose and mouth."
"Bulky and rugged but sound, with some drying tannins on the finish. It compensates by offering attractive flavors of black cherries, black olives and hints of asphalt and garrigue. Try it with hearty braises or stews."
"This smooth, lush Cabernet is brimming with blackberry, black currant, blueberry cedar and spice flavors. It's classic Cabernet. You'll find quite a scour of acidity running through the middle, which suggests this wine should pair with rich, fatty meats."
"A blend of Friulano and Verduzzo, this delivers aromas of candied fruit, yellow rose, butterscotch, spice and apricot. It opens a clear window onto the natural characteristics of both grape varieties."
"Pinot Grigio from the Friuli Grave tends to show extra creaminess and structure in the mouth. Here is a stellar example that's backed by flavors of peach, citrus and Golden Delicious apple."
"This bright white is redolent of tomato leaf, wild salvia and citrus. The brightness of the bouquet is followed by a satisfyingly creamy mouthfeel."
"Lime, apple and mineral aromas come with a note of eggy yeast. The mouthfeel is regular and a touch foamy, with semisweet flavors of kiwi, apple and gooseberry. Mild and feeling good on the finish, it's basic but well worth a go."
"This is a soft, creamed-apple style of wine, with a great shaft of acidity cutting through the crisp fruit. Kiwi and gooseberry fruits are lifted on the bright, lively finish."
"Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity."
"Produced by Three Rivers for celebrity winemaker Geoff Tate, the Insania is actually rather tame. Pretty fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum introduce the wine gracefully, then run into some stiff, drying, chalky tannins."
"This is intensely aromatic, with loads of tropical fruit, apple blossom and white peach notes on the nose and palate. It's fresh, tasty and big in body, yet deftly balanced. Soft, lemony acidity on the midpalate gets a boost of citrus rind and saline on the finish."
"This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners."
"This barrel-fermented Verdejo is interesting, but it's also a bit low on acidity. It smells like pine and blowsy flowers. Creamy, soft and cuddly on the palate, this has flavors of baked apple, wood resin and banana. It finishes round and sweet. Drink now."
"This wine has the variety's trademark notes of herb, green bell pepper, with a woodsy qulaity. This is a full-bodied effort, bearing a long, spicy finish."
"There are lot's of cherry, cola, sandalwood and exotic spice flavors in this Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, with a nice crispness from the acidity."
"This is a big, spicy wine, with very ripe flavors of red berries. It''ss concentrated, with layers of pepper a tight lemon-zest acidity."
"Aromas of watermelon and a dusting of natural vanilla mark the bouquet. On the palate, it's fleshy but still crisp and focused, with nectarine, red apple and strawberry flavors. The finish lasts, with some sweetness."
A Verdelho with a taste of nutsâ€”like Marcona almondsâ€”it gets more fruity and aromatic after a good swirl. This is marked by a tangy sweetness on the finish.
"Deliciously perfumed, this is as light as a feather, with baked apple and lemon flavors. It's crisp and honey sweetâ€”a great apÃ©ritif."
"Sauvignon Blanc has been a consistent performer for Hanna, usually yielding a rich, ripe wine with brisk acidity. The '11 is one of their best efforts. It's tart, clean and savory, with the pineapple, tangerine and Meyer lemon flavors touched with a slight sweetness."
"A simple but attractive CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne, with impressively pure cherry-berry fruit, medium body and a slightly chunky feel. Drink it over the next couple of years."
"Full and smoky, with bacon, blackberry and tire rubber on the nose. This is a bit grating in feel due to full tannins and acids, with wild berry flavors, bitter oak, black plum and darkness. Lengthy on the finish."
"A blend of 70% Pinot Grigio and 30% Ribolla Gialla, this bright white opens with floral notes of jasmine and honeysuckle, white pepper and stone fruit. The Ribolla Gialla element adds structure and notes of caramel and pineapple."
"Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season."
"This is a mix of fruit from both warm and cool vineyards, crafting a clean, fresh, lightly herbal wine with a pleasing dusty character. Hints of cocoa and toast annotate the tart berry fruit, with a thread of smoke and chalk running through the tannins."
"This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee."
"Flint and smoke aromas show strongly on this bottling, alongside hints of lemon balm and a rustic apple cider vinegar savory kick. Tangy smoked tangerine flavors show on the energized sip, where a unique sandalwood smoky quality plays with more cider-like tang."
"This potentially rich Champagne is still young. The Chardonnay and Pinot Noir that dominate the blend show tight acidity, minerality and a tangy, orange-like edge. Give it time to mature, and it will be splendid."
"Aged for an extra two years to soften its tense acidity, this Champagne is defiantly bone-dry yet not searing. Its ripe and rich fruitiness cushions the crisp acidity and taut, nervy citrus character. Drink now."
"Big tannins support the layers of extracted, concentrated fruit that leans red into cherry, cassis and currant. Char and vanilla speak for the oak."
"Baked blueberry and boysenberry aromas are more ripe than delicate. This Merlot is saturated and deeply tannic. Flavors of coffee, chocolate and lemon peel precede a toasty finish that overflows with chocolaty oak and lingering tannins. Drink through 2023."
"Delicate in cranberry and strawberry, this wine is highlighted in uplifted acidity and plenty of length and breadth within its medium-bodied structure. A pleasing streak of cardamom is consistent throughout, as accents of forest floor and cola figure in."
"This is a relatively thick and dense wine, grippy in tannin and oak at first, youthful and desiring of time and air. Beyond its strength, its shows the beginnings of delicacy and grace, commingling raspberry with clove and tea."
"This is a soft, smooth and earthy wine, still unraveling from its youth, that's crisp and fresh in acidity. Chewy still in texture, it offers a glorious celebration of red cherry, rhubarb, tea and clove."
"From a walled vineyard once owned by the local bishop, this wine is structured and firm while also having great red cherry and berry fruit. It's one of a number of Premier Crus from this producerâ€”and certainly the most expressive with its generous fruit and balanced tannins. Drink from 2018."
"Deliciously fruity but also well-structured, this full-bodied wine has excellent concentration and good balance. Effusive aromas of blueberry and black cherry lead to opulent but not overripe berry flavors that are lightly accented by clove and cinnamon nuances."
"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff."
"This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard. Light red plum and hibiscus aromas meet with sweet herbs and cinnamon spice on the nose. The lithe palate offers candied strawberry with thyme, anise and touches of garden herbs, with that red fruit flavor carrying deep into the finish. Would pair great with spicy food."
"The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode. It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020."
"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019."
"Wood spice, cherry and herb aromas are followed by luscious cherry flavors. It keeps you coming back for more with a high yum factor."
"There's an expert balance between lightly melted butter, pithy Meyer lemon and toasted marcona almond on the nose of this bottling from the region's iconic vineyard. The palate is wound up tightly, offering good grip and lots of textural length while showing flavors of chamomile, saffron, sea salt and more Meyer lemon rinds."
"Just 8% of this reserve spent time in new oak, putting the emphasis on juicy jammy flavors of cranberry fruit. It rolls into sour cherry, some citrus and a most refreshing, clean and vivid mouthfeel. Drink now and into the mid-2020s."
"A surprising whiff of black currant on the nose of this elegant white points to Scheurebeâ€”one of Germany's lesser-known grapes. Wittmann's version is particularly poised, offering loads of peach and grapefruit flavors, sharply contrasted by zesty lime and mineral tones. The finish is long and sleek, touched by a hint of bee pollen."
"This producer shows its preference for dry Champagnes with this bone-dry, oak-fermented bottling. With its bottle age and the softening effect of wood, it's generous and gently textured, leaving plenty of room for its bright fruit and balanced acidity to show. Drink from 2018."
"From the sought-after site on Westside Road, this wine delivers a nuanced, elegant expression of juicy red cherry, plum, pomegranate and light, compelling spice. With a depth of body and soft, integrated tannin, it's complex without being overpowering, finishing in a mix of sautÃ©ed mushroom and forest floor."
"Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first, with notes of iodine and rubber. But with airing this packed Syrah comes around. A flush saturated tannic palate is home to toasty blackened berry, coffee and spice flavors. On the finish, burnt toast and espresso flavors don't slip. Drink through 2022."
"One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least."
"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet."
"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out."
"Black plum, charred wood, coffee syrup and cracked black pepper show on the excellently bright nose of this bottling. The flavors are equally intriguing, with umami touches of charred beef along with rosemary, bay leaf, olie and more black pepper."
"Fresh green apple and grapefruit aromas are bolstered on the palate of this dry, elegantly balanced Riesling. It's light bodied yet delightfully creamy. A kiss of tangerine zest marks its moderately long finish."
"Merlot (63%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (23%) and Cabernet Franc. The aromas seem somewhat wound up at present, with notes of wood spice, vanilla and fresh herb. The palate is Ã¼ber-smooth, showing a fine sense of balance and polish."
"A 100% varietal wine, this offers upfront structure and gravelly texture, its tannins robust. The medium-bodied ripeness allows plenty of room for dried herb and cedar, accents to the bolder notions of black raspberry jam and coffee."
"This is sourced from 30-year-old WÃ¤denswil vines from a vineyard in the Elkton AVA. It's complex and compelling, showing layers of stone, strawberry, citrus, chocolate and sassafras. It's an elegant wine, well proportioned and modest in scope, but delicious."
"Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus. There is herbal and mineral depth to the palate, with raspberry, cranberry and pencil lead flavors that evolve toward fruit punch, thyme and earth. It's light in body but full of grippy texture."
"A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality."
"From one of the more exciting and westernmost vineyards in the region, this bottling shows earthy, gamey aromas alongside ripe red and purple fruits, pairing plum and black cherry with minty, musky herbs. The palate shows dried olive, tart orange peels, red plums, baked figs and pine needles, proving deliciously savory and intense."
"Heady scents of pressed jasmine, honey and candied orange waft out of the glass. The concentrated but elegant palate provides layers of mature apricot, lemon drop and ginger brightened by fresh acidity. It's vibrant and well balanced, with a persistent finish."
"Strong elements of black pepper and smoky oak beg for steak to be paired with this 100% varietal wine. It showcases sizable weight and a solid tannic structure, with supple expressions of black cherry and chocolate that linger long on the rich finish. This bold beauty should hold well through 2023."
"From Paso's blending vanguards, this mix of 62% Syrah, 19% Petite Sirah, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Malbec offers an intriguing nose of sesame, soy, cracked pepper, fresh blackberry and raw beef. There is cedar and toasted pine on the palate as well as smoked meats, black pepper, teriyaki and an elderberry-blackberry base."
"This is a gorgeous wine, blended with 8% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, and aged entirely in new French oak. Juicy waves of cassis and red currant are accented by dark chocolate, ultimately showcasing a lush, plush yet structured palate. It's decadent now, but should age well through 2022."
"Crisp green apple is the star in this well-made, balanced and elegant wine, that's tangy yet smooth, with a voluptuous tease of anise. Approachably structured, the complexity of the texture and lurking layers of further flavor suggest letting this wine open slowly to unveil its true self, and allowing it to linger on the palate."
"Deep aromas of dried strawberries and blueberries meet with hot bricks, dried meats, purple flowers, a touch of smoke and secondary notes of truffle on the nose of this delicious smelling and tasting wine. The layers of flavor on the palate range from black cherry to milk chocolate, framed by chalky tannins."
"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect."
"Scents of perfumed dark berry, rose, cake spice and aromatic herb unfold on this structured red. On the full-bodied palate, notes of chopped mint, mocha and white pepper accent a core of mature black cherry. It's young and assertive but well balanced, with firm tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018â€“2026."
"The estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder. Natural acidity is the star of the show, a nice surprise after a decadent honeyed color and bouquet. Serious texture and complexity give way to a touch of salted caramel and peach."
"From the gorgeous, mighty Pagani, planted in 1895, comes this powerfully rich and refined wine, a study in woodsy rusticity and layers of fig, blackberry and a stick of cinnamon. Full bodied and luxurious on the palate, a lithe jolt of acidity rears its head just before the finish, trying to compete with the licorice and leather. Drink now through 2020."
"Coming from a remote estate on the edge of the LubÃ©ron mountains in the north of Provence, this wine is impressively rich. It gains great concentration and structure from the Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah in the blend. Full of ripe red fruits, it is dense at the end."
"Smoky, charred aromas of blackberry and blackened spices set up a bold palate with energy to spare. Blackberry and cassis flavors are rich, toasty and chocolaty, while the finish on this full-bodied, ripe Malbec is lengthy and moderately complex. Drink through 2021."
"Named after the Negrel family, owners of the estate, this is the top cuvÃ©e in their range. Aging in wood gives it a surprising series of flavors ranging from caramel to spice to buttery toast. While some of the fruit is lost along the way, the wine has a rounded, very complete character that is rich and made for food."
"Discovery Vineyard Cab makes up most of this wine, with just a splash of Champoux vineyard Franc to fill it out. Very pretty, very focused aromas of spice box, red and black fruit and herb are followed by a fruit-forward, shamelessly appealing yet still elegant, balanced palate that puts a premium on purity, with a well integrated structure surrounding it all."
"Welcoming aromas of wood spice, plum and blackberry become more smoky with airing. This strong-boned RDD is pure and deep, with manageable tannins. Generous flavors of spiced blackberry, tobacco and vanilla finish long, elegant and with a lot in reserve. Drink from 2017 through 2030."
"Winemaker Dennis Martin puts grape grower Stephen Miller's signature on this wine, a nod to the importance of this historic vineyard. The wine shows bright strawberry and raspberry with touch of savory wood smoke as well as hibiscus-laced pastry and a pinch of thyme. Earthy sagebrush and wild herb flavors frame the palate, where cooked cherries and cranberries are spiced by cardamom and dried ginger spice."
"It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex."
"This mostly Syrah blends in 6% Grenache, combining the two grapes from the property's estate into an opaque, juicy expression of black licorice, tar, cigar, grilled mushrooms atop a meaty steak and plenty of black pepper. Big and bold in every sense of the word, it retains just enough acidity to maintain an inviting nature and beguiling floral backbone."
"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine."
"In the big, ripe and saturated school of winemaking, this wine has a deep color, oodles of black cherry and blackberry flavors and full body. It also has enough firm tannin and acidity to keep the structure lively and the finish fresh, so it's a lot of fun to drink and can take on all kinds of rich proteins at dinner."
"This is big boisterous wine from Elias Fernandez and Doug Shafer that has been given some nice time in bottle after four years in new French oak. It's a viscous, black-as-night kind of experience. Coconut macaroon and juicy blackberry and blueberry substantiate structured, integrated tannin, finishing with an unexpected elegance."
"Plump black plums and concentrated hibiscus fruit meet with cola, sarsaparilla and tart dried orange rind on the nose of this bottling. The palate is more earth-driven, with crushed rocks, pine needle and mint flavors spicing up the tart plum skins and berries. The texture is excitingly grippy."
"Spicy cracked peppercorns, light tar, fresh picked lavender and light purple fruits show on the savory nose of this bottling. More strong pepper notes show on the palate, as do tart elderberries, sesame, soy and hoisin elements, with a nice smoked meat character adding to the delicious complexity."
"There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once."
"Softened by 6% Merlot, this lovely concoction opens with a waft of smoky cigar box, becoming a bold, loud expression of the variety dotted in classic notes of cassis and cedar. A luxuriously velvety texture is the standout, though, supported by great structure and length."
"Smoky and intense from the get-go, this saturated, black-as-night Malbec is full of blackberry, cassis and gamy aromas. While it goes heavy on the gas, the wine's structure is up to it. Flavors of chocolate, burnt toast, salt and blackberry finish toasty and long, with savory blackened spice notes. Drink through 2023."
"This is a lovely wine, classically rendered in cedar, herb and red cherry. The dried herb and forest floor elements persist on the palate, with bursts of acidity giving it life and lingering persistence, the tannins well-integrated."
"The aromas are bright, with notes of barrel spice, vanilla, pineapple and lees. The palate is full bodied, with textured and richly flavored tropical fruit notes that lead to a warm vanilla-filled finish. The oak seems a bit heavy handed."
"Aromas of sea salt, olive brine, smoked meat, herb and earth lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that run warm on the finish. There are plenty of good things going on but they don't seem to entirely come together."
"This wine tastes fresh and brisk, like apricots and lemons, yet a silky-smooth texture adds depth and interest to make it more than just a one-note, fruity style of wine. It comes from an over-achieving winery located one county inland from Napa."
"Here's a mouthwatering, succulent red that arrives with aromas and flavors of juicy black cherry, licorice, white pepper and graphite. It's light bodied, fresh and savory, with solid but polished tannins. An almond note gives it a pleasantly bitter finish. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon."
"Fruity and ripe, the wine also has some solid structure to give it a core of dark tannins. The black-currant fruits are developing well, bringing their crispness to the party. Drink this wine from 2018."
"This bend of 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache is nevertheless very pale in hue. the nose hints at wet stone, thyme and bay leaf, while the medium-bodied palate delivers a harmonious blend of red berries and citrus. Long on the finish, with mouthwatering persistence."
"This is a juicy wine with its red fruits and attractive acidity. The wood aging still shows, perhaps too strongly, but that fruit is already a major factor in the success of the wine. Drink from 2019."
"From a Grand Cru estate, this second wine shows the same rich fruit and generous structure as the winery's first wine. It's just softer with an approachable character and generous black fruits that will enable it to mature relatively quickly. Drink from 2020."
"Ripe luscious black-cherry and berry notes lend heft to this bold concentrated rosÃ©. It's just a shade off dry, but balances neatly, juxtaposing crisp acidity against lavish texture and a pleasantly clingy finish."
"A ripe perfumed wine with fine tannins as well as dense fruit. Blackberry flavors are up there along with the acidity and crisp aftertaste. It's a wine with a good future, ready to drink from 2018."
"This refreshing, well-structured wine offers vivid but light fruit flavors, a crisp balance and mouthwatering texture. It has lots of fresh citrus flavors that will pair well with salty meats and all kinds of seafood."
"Two-thirds Chenin Blanc and one-third GrÃ¼ner Veltliner, this wine opens with aromas of apple, white pepper, herb and spice. It brings a sense of freshness and purity, along with a rounded feel."
"This one-of-a-kind in the state wine was fermented on skins for 12 days, giving it a light-orange color. The aromas leap up from the glass, with notes of spice, lychee, orange peel and mineral. The palate is dry and textured, with a rich but still sleek feel. Put it on the dinner table to see it shine."
"The aromas are so light you need to strain to get at them, with notes of vanilla, coffee and cherry. The palate brings plentiful coffee and cherry flavors that show a pleasing sense of texture. One wants more aromatically, but the palate delivers."
"This incredibly zesty and fruity bottling shows raspberry, lavender and white pepper on the nose. It's fun to sip, with snappy red fruits and hibiscus most prominent. Complexity comes from touches of rooibos tea and potpourri. It's still extremely youthful."
"That herbal, yeasty tang of GrÃ¼ner is on display on the nose. The dry palate further brings out the earthy aspect with miso, stone, yeast and lemon. The body is light and balanced with a savory but diffuse finish."
"This is an expressive example of this variety, especially considering the stainless steel aging. The aromas are bright, with notes of apple, pear and melon. The cantaloupe flavors are broad and fleshy, lingering on the finish. It brings a lot of appeal."
"Although a flinty touch of reduction still hangs on the nose, freshness and verve await underneath. The palate is juicy, slight, dry and very refreshing. It offers a slender, lemony expression of Pinot Blanc with a clean-cut finish."
"Notes of tart lemon peel appear on the nose. The lean and light body continues in that lemony vein with brisk freshness. This wine is light, with a slight texture made up of yeastiness and zesty lemon. Some notes of grass appear on the finish. Drink this light, dry wine soon."
"It's always a treat to discover a good, well-made but not overpowering wine. This one has nothing in excess, just moderate and crisp fruit flavors with light spicy accents. An appetizing texture backed by good acidity leads to a clean, dry finish. This unoaked wine from northern California should be a crowd pleaser."
"A dark, smoky smudge seems to cover the red-cherry notes on the nose. The palate is juicy and light, with this red-cherry nature at its core. Easy and light, it's a perfect fruit-driven summer red."
"Sweet honeysuckle, lime blossoms and honeydew show on the very flowery nose of this bottling from a newer property near the old mining town of Pozo. The sip tightens up smartly with Anjou pear and honeysuckle flavors, but it's the powerful acidity that makes for a compelling palate."
"Almost luscious pear aromas and notes of peardrop make for a very fruity nose. The palate has a fruity, lemony ease, while the body is slender, dry and has some spritz. The lemon freshness is vivid, brightening everything on this easy, fruity summer wine."
"Purple fruit and wood spice intermingle on the aromas, along with clove, herb and baking spice, showing a touch of volatility. The fruit flavors are big and bold, bringing a sense of structure and liveliness. It's an intriguing example of the variety from an up-and-coming vineyard."
"A hint of tropicality hovers above the nose, recalling passion fruit. The palate restricts itself to fresh lemon and green apple. This is light, dry, juicy and refreshingâ€”ideal for a sunny day as a light apÃ©ritif."
"This medium-bodied blend of 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah is simple but satisfying. Ripe cherries and raspberries carry the load, dressed up by hints of vanilla and cinnamon. A soft dustiness marks the texture, turning silky on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2020."
"This is a true pan-Washington Cabernet, with fruit coming from 12 different vineyards scattered across the Columbia Valley. It's 100% varietal as aromas of char, toast, black cherry meats, herb, cranberry and spice are followed by elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of heft and grip."
"This indigenous Cretan variety shows its character in the deft hands of Lyrarakis, grown at high altitude. Aromas of fresh pineapple, citrus and flowers lead into pear, green apple and saline notes. Balanced and bright."
"A touch of funky yeastiness plays on the nose before the lemon zestiness shines through. The palate is slender and light, focusing on that bright, fresh lemon note. This is easy, juicy and very refreshing."
"Light and lively aromas of dried red berries, concentrated roses, cola and black plums show on the nose of this very accessible and pleasurable Sangiovese. The cohesive palate integrates cherry, cola and milk-chocolate flavors into an easy-drinking frame, perfect for barbecues or family-style Italian meals."
"An easy Cabernet, soft and fruity, great for drinking now, at a pretty good price. It's dry and gentle in the mouth, with some real complexity, combining ripe cherries and blackberries with suggestions of dried herbs, cocoa and tobacco."
"Crisp and light with pretty mineral dustings behind the ripe peach and melon aromas, this Gavi shows a full and generous style. Its nicest quality is that it offers both softness in the mouth and elegance on the bouquet."
"Sauvignon Blanc is, in general, one of Baja's more consistent performers. This version is light in color, with varietally familiar aromas of nettle, grapefruit and passion fruit. It's a bit weighty, with apple, grapefruit and tropical flavors. A mild bitterness can be found on the finish."
"There's plenty of ripe berry-cherry fruit, fine acids and big tannins on this Cab, but it just doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul. It is, however, a satisfying Cabernet, offering lots of elegance for drinking now and over the next few years."
"Ripe and luscious, this decadent Cabernet Franc is chock full of ripe red cherry and plum fruit, accented with purple violets and fresh herb tones. It's bold in alcohol and soft in style, but delicately framed by brisk acidity and a ruffle of feathery tannins."
"Bright red-fruit aromas are matched by dry spice and leathery scents. The feel on this blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is juicy and clampy, while flavors of red cherry, plum and currant come with a vanilla shading. This finishes crisp, with punchy acidity."
"Mild berry and cherry aromas are standard and slightly oaky. The palate on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is choppy and tannic, while earthy flavors of cherry and plum are pushed by firm acids. This finishes tannic, with coffee and herbal flavors."
"It's rare to find a varietally labeled Grenache that comes in under 13% alcohol, but here you have it. Blended with 10% Syrah, it has notes of white pepper, smoked meat, savory spices and red fruit. What it lacks in terms of depth it makes up for in purity and elegance."
"Named after the blending of Steelhead Run and Ox vineyard blocks, this appealing wine is fresh and varietal with notes of ripe peach and herbs. Aged six months in stainless steel and coming in at a low 12% alcohol, the fruit concentration is lighter in style but still offers enjoyment."
"Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc hangs together easily on this herb-dominant wine. The texture has a creamy character, showing green fruits, lively acidity and a bright orange-zest aftertaste."
"GrÃ¼ner Veltliner, though still rare, shows good promise in Oregon. This is a big, sappy, ripe version that's borderline syrupy, with big flavors of peaches and apricots. But the supporting acids, and a lick of mineral, keep it from crashing."
"A touch of oak adds a sweet, smoky creaminess to this wine, but it's really dominated by Sauvignon Blanc's acidity and racy spearmint and tropical fruit. The alcohol is moderate, making it easy to drink."
"This is a good Pinot Noir that's full-bodied, dry and silky in the mouth, with crisp acidity. It shows raspberry, cola and green tea flavors. Hard to predict if it has a future, so drink nowâ€“2014."
"This is an easy, gentle wine that's a little soft, with superripe cherry, persimmon and red licorice flavors. Delicious in the California way, it's showing its best now."
"With its light prickle on the tongue, this is as fresh as possible. It's clean, packed with green and citrus fruits, and boosted with some textured richness. Drink at once."
"The dynamic sisters that run this estate deliver a clean and territory-driven line of white wines. This easy Soave Classico opens with peach, pear, citrus and a touch of fragrant honeysuckle flower. It's pure and focused overall."
"Four years running this wine has scored 87 and been a Best Buy. The bouquet is scratchy but nicely aromatic, including hints of spice to go with ripe berry scents. The palate is jammy and home to rooty berry, mild spice and very light oak flavors. The finish is a bit hot and fiery, which food will tame."
"This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring. Give it a few years in the cellars to let everything knit together."
This bubbly Prosecco Superiore offers vibrant tones of white flower and cut grass followed by light touches of peach and honeydew melon. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft with a subtle touch of sweetness.
"Softly delicious, this is a beautiful Merlot to drink now. It's a little hot in alcohol on the finish, but feels elegant in the mouth, offering waves of cherries, currants and mocha."
"Here's a Chardonnay-based sparkler from Piedmont that opens with bright tones of lemon and sweet grapefruit followed by yeasty tones of freshly baked bread. There's some bitter almond as well, which adds tartness to the finish."
"Extra sweetness and density give this wine a full and generous personality. Dry Proseccos usually show a little extra peach juice and nectarine, as this wine does, without being heavy or cloying."
"An easy Pinot Noir, but by no means lacking elegance. It shows the moderate body and crisp, citrusy acidity that usually marks Edna Valley Pinot Noir, with pure, direct flavors of sour-cherry candy, cola, cinnamon and toast."
"Mostly Syrah, with just a dash of Petite Sirah (2%) and Petit Verdot (1%), this red from Sawtooth and Skyline vineyards brings light notes of smoked meat, chocolate, and flowers. The enjoyment here is mainly focused on mouthfeel, which is voluptuous and rich, leading to an open finish."
"This unusual blend of 85% Syrah, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Petite Sirah comes together nicely, with the Syrah lending notes of cranberry and smoked meat and the Petit(e)s adding some heft to the plush texture and bitterness on the finish."
"Named after the Nez Perce name for the Clearwater River, this blend is mostly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Syrah thrown in the mix. The aromas are light, with notes of berry and sweet spices. The cherry flavors are very soft, getting a bit attenuated on the back half on this otherwise pleasant red."
Here's a pure expression of the Garganega grape that sees (in part) 8 months of oak aging for extra density and thickness. The wine shows spicy notes of cinnamon and white pepper backed by peach and candied fruit.
"Made with the indigenous Garganega grape (the same variety that makes Soave), this richly extracted white wine opens with an off-gold color and ripe notes of apricot and peach nectar."
"This pretty white wine from northern Italy opens with an ashy, mineral feel and segues to aromas of candied fruit, peach and citrus. It is nearing the end of its drinking window so don't bother putting this bottle aside."
"This plush, full-bodied wine is already delicious, delivering wave after wave of savory fruit flavor, something like soy-marinated, char-grilled beef. Tannins are supple enough to make this wine drinkable now, yet plentiful enough to suggest ample cellaring potential. Drink now-2030."
"Each year, this wine is intended to be an experiment. This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley. Yeasty on the nose, the result is rich and decadent, a wine that's juicy and velvety in black and red fruit and pillowy tannins. A warmth of spice lingers on the finish."
"From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention. Hints of rose petals adorn the floral accents, while the midpalate emphasizes flavors of raspberries and orange peel. At first a bit shy, this opens slowly and reveals hidden complexities and enduring length. Drink now through 2025."
"Lifted notes of honey and rose petal play on the nose, the palate is altogether more lively than the nose suggests: sprightly and fresh, concentrated and caramel-tinged with lemon freshness. This strikes an appetizing, moreish palate and makes for joyful drinking."
"Ripe fragrant, yellow mirabelle plums constitute the chief perfume of this charming wine. The palate holds even more fruity nuance but is dry, concentrated and linear, being carried forward by zesty freshness and lemony overtones. This is clean, charming, taut and dry with a bracing nature and a clean, brisk finish."
"This full-bodied wine is rich without ever seeming overdone. Subtle smoke notes frame bold fruitâ€”tangerine, pineapple and apricotâ€”and gingery spice, while the finish is long, peppery and refreshing. Drink nowâ€“2020."
"From a two-acre block within the amazing Maple Vineyard planted in 1910, this wine also contains 10% Petite Sirah and 10% mixed blacks. Baked berry pie comes to mind first, conjuring up all things good and right in the world, topped in bourbon whipped cream and nutmeg. Good acidity buoys the proceedings. Drink now through 2021."
"Aromas of wood grain, vanilla, butter and fino Sherry are elegant and attractive for this style of white Rioja. On the palate, this oak-aged Viura is smooth, while creamy flavors of oak, apricot and peach excel. A smooth finish with plenty of vanilla and core acidity indicates this will age well for another 10 years."
"The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon. Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink nowâ€“2025."
"A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness. Really, this is a case where you can have the best of both worlds."
"A very subdued nose suggests some dried orange peel but the palate is full of life: there is bracing, bright and lemon-scented acidity on the dry palate and drenched stone. There is concentration and a texture of the finest, purest citrus oil. This is wonderfully mature and ready now but has the stuffing to last. Drink 2016â€“2020."
"There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge. This is off-dry and concentrated, definite but with a light touch. There is an intriguing hint of bitter orange peel that draws you in and pull this onto a higher plane."
"Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic. Aromas of browned toast, popcorn, Meyer-lemon pith, honey pollen and a mineral herbal chamomile character show on the nose. A vibrant chalkiness reveals itself on the sip, with lemon blossom and grapefruit pith keeping the palate tight, grippy and texturally zippy."
"Completely stainless-fermented and aged, this is a blockbuster of a white wine, refreshing and exotic in floral intoxication. Dry and light-bodied, it offers an edginess of slate-like minerality along with aromas of apricot and peach, finishing in a dusting of white pepper."
"This is a new wine from the hands of master winemaker Luis Duarte. With its rich black fruits and dense tannins, it's also a wine that is firmly structured. Wood aging has added a layer of complexity and broadened out the fruits and dark tannins. Drink from 2017."
"Creamy in texture and floral in aroma, this is a lovely and well-integrated white wine, with well-crafted characteristics of pear and honeyed apple. Medium bodied, it'll pair well at the table and on its own."
"Boosted by 5% Petit Verdot, this bottling shows lush aromas of fudge, black plum, black currant, soy and black pepper. The palate is dense and thick with more black fruit as well as caramel, purple flowers, milk chocolate and mint-chip ice cream, proving concentrated and decadent."
"Pommard and WÃ¤denswil clones are combined here, yielding a stylish, well-defined wine with spicy berry fruit. Flavors punch through into a deep and detailed finish, with streaks of cola and caramel. The balance is spot-on."
"As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017."
"This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by JoÃ£o Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018."
"A spray of rose petals perfumes this aromatic spÃ¤tlese. Its freshness is exhilarating, contrasting lavish layers of honey and marmalade against the sharp bites of pineapple, tangerine and lemon. Cutting and spry, yet deeply penetrating, it finishes on a lingering pollen note."
"With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy. The flavors lean savory into meaty aspects of currant and clove, waiting to find companionship in fruit. Drink now after a decant, or cellar through 2023."
"You'll find aromas of tomato leaf, passion fruit, crushed rock and green bell pepper on this radiant white. The bright, savory palate delivers tropical fruit, tangerine zest, dill, celery and mineral alongside tangy acidity. It's an extremely impressive showing for this challenging vintage."
"Subtle notes of clean, fresh lemon zest promise pleasure, the palate reveals a far riper aspect of fresh red apple and baked apples. The dry palate remains zingy and clean and provides ample textured freshness. The effect is that of fresh apple sorbet."
"Based on this example and a few other informal tastings, 2014 will be a top vintage for Rieslings from Western Australia. Aromas of lime sherbet and wet stone lead into a crisply focused palate loaded with citrusy tartness that lingers on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now with shellfish, and consider holding some for up to 10 years."
"Reserved red-cherry fruit aromas gain complexity with fog-soaked sagebrush, dried purple flowers and an earthy mushroom character on the nose. Roasted shiitake, marjoram, crushed Brazil nuts and a hint of cardamom play on the dark, spicy, earthy palate, laid across a bed of cranberry fruit."
"Freshly cut red, yellow and green apples make both nose and palate very fruity. The dry palate with its lemony freshness and open aspect lets all the apple flavors shine and inflects them here and there with baked and dried apple, too. Wonderfully fruity and pure."
"This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around. Very fresh in aroma, it's slightly yeasty like freshly fermented wine, and with subtly gorgeous cherry and blackberry flavors layered with light cedar and cocoa spiciness. Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork."
"This cuvÃ©e is made with the oldest Pommard clones in the estate vineyard. It's a sharp-edged, reserve-level wine with a defining streak of peppery herb. The black fruits and barrel flavors of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate promise further depth as it ages. Drink 2020â€“2030."
"The 2011 Night Sky shows more earthy character than the 2012, as upfront aromas of soil, blackberry leaf and pepper are grounded by ripe fruit tones of black currant, plum and mulberry. Medium weight on the palate, with velvety tannins that grip through the long, spicy finish. The dense, tight mouthfeel, firm structure and overall balance suggest this wine will age well through 2022."
"This full-bodied wine has a voluptuous entry that's slightly tropical in pineapple and Asian pear, as well as vanilla-layered oak. The expansive beginning segues smoothly into a higher-wire act of minerality, finishing fleshy and fresh."
"This wine brings aromas of blackberry, dates and spice. The palate displays abundant cherry flavors with lightly chalky tannins."
"Syrupy thick at first, decadent enough for a king, this rich red is defined by vanilla French toast and blackberry jam aromas and flavors. It finds balance midway through on the palate, veering into crisper red tones of cranberry and rhubarb. Time will help mellow things out. Cellar through 2020."
"Livelier than usual in texture and popping with bright citrus aromas and flavors, this light-bodied and barrel-fermented wine is a great palate-cleanser and will pair beautifully with dishes like raw oysters and herbed goat cheese. It smells and tastes like lemon, lime, green apple and kiwi, and has great balance."
"Aromas of red berry, rose and cake spices lead the way on this ripe, forward Barolo. The round palate offers black cherry, raspberry, licorice and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It's already extremely accessible, so don't leave it in the cellar for too long. Drink 2016â€“2021."
"Ripe black cherry and vanilla swirl around notes of cedar and dusty tannins, combining seamlessly on the palate. From an appellation not known for the variety, it does justice to mountain fruit and power, finishing with substance."
"This structured Dolcetto offers aromas of blue- and black-skinned fruit, violet, chopped herbs and kitchen spices. The vibrant palate delivers black cherry, black currant, clove, tobacco and anise while firm, refined tannins provide the framework."
"Fruity aromas of mature berry mingle with notes of dark cooking spice and chopped herbs on this savory, medium-bodied red. The round, concentrated palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and tobacco framed in firm acidity and a velvety texture."
"This warm-vintage wine is more aromatically reticent than recent vintages, with notes of stone fruit, slate and mineral. It drinks a hair off dry, with depth to the lightly spritzy fruit flavors and razor-sharp acidity."
"Perfumed plum and raspberry aromas are slightly earthy and leathery. This is medium-to-full in body, with smooth, chunky tannins. Earthy, lightly baked plum and wild-berry flavors finish loamy and expansive. Drink through 2017."
"While dry in style, this lithe, delicately framed Riesling packs a punch of ripe, rich tropical fruit. It's blossomy and buoyantly fruity, yet brashly mineral as well. Made using â€œvirgin berriesâ€, uniquely seedless grapes with a tendency towards exuberant aroma and flavor concentration."
"All varietal, this wine offers unique aromas of toast, fig, dried herb and exotic spice. The purple fruit flavors are deft in style with a pleasing sense of balance, length and texture."
"Dark berry, herb and fig aromas lead to dense, full and palate-coating dark fruit flavors. It checks all the boxes for varietal correctness, concentration and value."
"The winery's larger bottling of the variety, one it has mastered for decades, this wine is a mix of baked plum and rustic leather notes. It's softly tannic, with pronounced jolts of tobacco and black pepper. With small amounts of other RhÃ´ne varieties, from Syrah to Viognier, it meanders to the finish, with a distinct trace of minerality."
"Similarly to it's Virgin Berry sibling, Roth's regular label Dry Riesling has a distinctly green, woodsy tone lending an alpine feel to sweet-tart peach and apricot flavors. It's brisk and fine-footed, yet zesty tangerine and grapefruit acidity persist long on the finish."
"This is a full-bodied and full-flavored wine with rich and deep aromas, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels substantial but polished. It starts with black cherry and woodsy aromas, then goes to lively but broad cherry, plum and nutmeg notes. The finish stays flavorful and dry."
"From a knoll in Carneros, oft thought of as chilly for Cabernet, this wine exhibits cooler aspects of the variety, from pencil lead and cedar to dried herb. It is complemented by fruitier characteristics of cassis and plum, finishing in dusty, structured tannins. Cellar through 2017â€“2020."
"Smoky cinnamon and nutmeg pierce the entry of this wine, a dense, full-bodied expression of place. Layers of rich cherry and strawberry lie over classic varietal earthiness, finishing medium in length."
"Otis Harlan Vineyard in the Rattlesnake Hills provides the fruit for this wine. Distinctive aromas of lees, almond, toast and grass lead to creamy stone-fruit flavors that show persistence on the finish."
"Full-bodied and concentrated, this opens with aromas of crushed black plum, spicy blueberry, vanilla and dried sage. The dense, warm palate delivers dried black cherry, blackberry extract, oak and black pepper alongside velvety tannins. The soft acidity shows the heat of the vintage, so enjoy soon."
"Aromas of dark-skinned fruit, cedar and allspice lead the nose on this smooth, full-bodied red. The structured palate doles out mature black currant, black cherry, peppercorn and espresso that follow through to the finish. Soft acidity and ripe, firm tannins provide the framework. Drink 2016â€“2022."
"Brooding aromas of barrel spice, black cherry, coffee bean and herb lead to tart, focused fruit and barrel flavors that linger."
"Plum, prune and raspberry aromas are solid. This shows a bright, juicy palate along with traditional Rioja flavors of vanilla, tobacco, savory oak and dried red-berry fruits. Drink through 2018."
"All Syrah, this blend of Yakima Valley and Wahluke Slope fruit offers aromas and flavors of cocoa, vanilla, pepper and dark cherry. The pleasing interplay of fruit and barrel comes with a soft, pillowy feel."
"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this elegant sparkler offers aromas of rose and red berry. The vibrant, focused palate delivers cherry, strawberry and a hint of cake spices alongside bright acidity and an elegant perlage."
"Aromas of underbrush, charred earth and a hint of cedar lead the nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot. The extracted palate delivers mature black currant, dried blackberry, espresso and black pepper alongside dusty tannins."
"This wine is aromatically reserved with notes of milk chocolate, char, berry, barrel spices and high-toned herbs. It's silky and polished in feel, with richness and elegance to the coffee flavors."
"This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone. Earthy spice and an exotic notion of orange blossom dance around a light, clear body and high-toned minerality. It hails from a foggy, shaded vineyard in Freestone."
"This opens with aromas of underbrush, leather, berry and a balsamic note. The forward palate offers dried cherry, white pepper, tobacco and the warmth of alcohol alongside firm tannins. Drink this sooner rather than later."
"Straw-yellow in the glass, this wine from organically grown, nearly 35-year-old vines shows iodine, citrus pith, yogurt and seared lemon peels in the restrained, minerally nose. The even-keeled, focused palate seamlessly integrates dairy elements with tangerine rinds and a mellow acidity."
"This appealing wine displays aromas of cherry, plum, cocoa, pencil lead and Mounds Bar. It's reserved in style with tart cranberry and cherry flavors, showing a good sense of acid balance along with grainy tannins."
"From vineyards in the high-desert Cuyama Valley comes this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Tempranillo, 20% Grenache and 15% Petite Sirah. On the nose, it shows chopped fresh mint, rose blossoms, fennel, black cherries and teriyaki beef jerky. Black pepper and soy mark the palate, along with blackberry juice and a slate-driven minerality."
"Still closed, this is redolent of the elegant, nutty notes of new French oak which nonetheless complement the ripe but supple cherry fruit. The tannins are superfine and the addition of peppery Zweigelt to this Cabernet-Merlot blend lends spice and verve to the mix. This was made for the long run, so give it some bottle age and allow it to meld into its elegant self. Drink from 2018."
"This deep-colored, full-bodied red gets a little swagger in its step from enticing smoky oak aromas and powerful black-fruit flavors that also carry that spicy oak streak. This is brash enough for slow-cooked barbecue but sophisticated enough for osso buco. The texture is fine-grained from supportive tannin, and the finish lingers. Best now through 2018."
"Made with Sangiovese blended with 10% Ciliegiolo and 5% Alicante Bouschet, this savory wine opens with aromas of underbrush, ripe berry, tobacco leaf and Mediterranean herb. The vibrant, refined palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, orange peel, licorice and white pepper alongside supple tannins. It closes on a mineral note. Enjoy through 2020."
"Although the fine mountain site straddles both Napa and Sonoma, this wine's fruit is all Sonoma, the bulk of it Cabernet Franc, with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dried cranberry shows on the nose and palate, followed by chalky tannins and a refined use of oak, finishing in a bite of currant and cherry. Enjoy through 2017."
"This is a well-balanced, well-structured white wine that's sure to evolve through 2020, at least. It's certainly attractive now, with subtle toasty notes of sweet spice and wood-grilled apple alongside hints of kiwi, sweet grass, green plum and lime. The medium-weight palate offers ample acidity and a streak of minerality that keeps things fresh and lifted through the softly spiced finish."
"Aromas of violet, iris, forest floor, woodland berry and allspice lead the nose on this structured, savory wine. The concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry, mocha, clove, tobacco and licorice alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's firm and well balanced."
"The Dillons Point subregion of Marlborough often produces particularly pungent examples of Sauvignon Blanc, but this wine doesn't quite hew to that mold. The herbal notes are prominent but well mannered, backed by plenty of mild citrusâ€”think white grapefruitâ€”and melon. Ample weight, a silky texture and a lengthy finish complete the package."
"Lively notes of fresh yellow plum and mandarin open up into a friendly, fresh palate that combines rich fruit and zingy citrus to great effect. The result is lip-smacking freshness with lots of midpalate concentration and zing."
"Aromas of dark chocolate, dried and fresh herbs, raspberries and black cherry predominate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Creamy, rich and focused, it has a pleasing sense of texture and vanilla flavors that carry across the finish. It's truly a standout wine at this price."
"This classic, iconic Pinotage opens with dense aromas of pressed purple violets, forest berries, raspberry sauce and fudge brownie. The lush and decadent palate offers more of the same, with a crushed velvet texture and final notes of licorice and toasted spice that linger long. It's delicious now, but should hold well through 2022."
"Intriguing aromas of lavender, hoja santa and green tobacco blend nicely with blackberry and blueberry scents. This top-flight Bonarda feels lush and only moderately tannic. Blackberry, leather and mild briny flavors finish minty and lightly herbal. Drink now."
"Always released after a further year's aging, this rich and full-bodied wine is now at its peak. With a dense texture, layers of spice and vanilla as well as intense red fruits, this powerful wine expresses the more complex side of Provence rosÃ©. Drink now."
"Produced by the owners of ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape estate ChÃ¢teau Mont-Redon, this is a full and fruity wine. It has a good balance between acidity and red berry fruits that give a rich character. Packed with flavor, it's ready to drink."
"While the wine is really pale in color, it does have a great range of flavors, offering red fruit notes balanced by beautiful acidity and citrus streaks. It's gently textured, giving a good bite to the fruitiness at the end."
"This rich and impressive wine has structure and a firm texture, partly from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend (45% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon). It is dense and full of juicy red fruits, caramel and delicious spice. Production is only 2,500 cases. It would be worth aging for a few more months, so drink from late 2015."
"Classic gooseberry and pink grapefruit notes feature gentle herbal nuances on the nose. There's ample weight and texture on the palate, with a burst of mouthwatering citrus on the finish."
"Very fruity and fresh, this wine has crisp apples as well as red fruit giving it a bright, delicious feeling. The acidity goes right through the wine, giving a beautifully fresh feel that points up the fragrant raspberries. Vineyards are in the heart of the sandy soils of the Saint Tropez peninsula."
"Rounded and soft, this rich rosÃ© is fruity while also perfumed. The blending of Syrah in the mix gives the wine a sense of power and concentration, making it an adquate partner at the dinner table."
"This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants. It could benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from late 2015."
"Only the second vintage of this vineyard-designate wine from an estate property, this bottling offers spicy cherry, black tea and dried herb, backed by oaky backbone and structure. Dark chocolate and leather play on the palate in subtle waves, hitting their strides on the finish. Cellar through 2020."
"As typical for Dry River Pinots, this one is pretty surly in its youth. Intense and astringent, it packs layers of dusty black-cherry fruit into a tightly coiled frame. Try after 2019."
"Floral and herbal from the get-go, this medium-bodied white from a great vineyard offers a lot to like. Stainless-steel fermentation gives it a lean underbelly, rounded out by sharp Meyer lemon and tangerine, buoyed by mouthwatering acidity. Green apple and an accent of honey peak on the finish."
"Light in color and weight, this vineyard-designate conveys a wealth of rose petals, earth and bright, crisp red cherry. Compellingly layered and shy, it defines the term ethereal. The finish is medium in length and accented in spicy cardamom."
"This wine combines fruit from both cool and warm sites, which in the vintage might have both leaned on the warmer side. Black fruit and licorice give it a burly character at first. Decanting or letting the wine open in the glass will help, but still it retains smooth, velvety tannins and resolved oak."
"Alluring notes of Asian five spice and wet stone frame ripe cherry aromas in this medium-bodied wine. The texture is firm, becoming faintly dusty on the finish, but the wine is approachable now for its cherry fruit and appealing damp clay quality. Drink nowâ€“2018."
"Sweet oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a jammy bouquet that also features black plum and blackberry scents. This blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat feels full, lifted and balanced. Ripe, enticing flavors of wild berry and cassis are backed by toast, chocolate, vanilla and coconut notes as well as heat and burn. Drink through 2019."
"Even Carrick's entry-level wine has turned out well in 2013, offering a sturdy, robust mouthful of dark fruit. Plum, espresso and dark chocolate mingle on the nose and palate, while the finish is long, faintly dusty and mouthwatering. Drink 2017â€“2025."
"An addition to the worldwide JCB brand, produced by the Boisset family of Burgundy, this feels rich and sumptuous, full of ripe red fruits and juicy plums. It is also balanced and well structured. Drink this wine with food."
"Heading nicely in the crisp and aromatic direction, this is a light and bright wine. It has a citrus flavor that is balanced by richer pear and plum fruits. The wine is ready to drink."
"This soft wine has a gentle texture and smooth white fruits. It is fruity and lightly perfumed. With its crisp edge of acidity, is totally ready to drink."
"Onion skin orange in color, this is a full and fat wine. It has attractive red-berry fruit and just the right amount of acidity to keep it fresh and crisp. Drink now."
"Saucy berry and tea aromas are herbal, earthy and stewed. This feels full but syrupy. Flavors of cooked berry, molasses and mocha finish sweet and soupy, with only a touch of acidic offset."
"Mushy citrus and papaya aromas are waxy and lack pop. Angular and lemony in feel, this varietal white offers a one-note flavor profile based on lemon. A ringing, citric finish affords for a hint of tropical fruit."
"In a medium sweet style, the wine has a light prickle and fine citrus acidity to balance the soft freshness. It is a refreshing wine, totally drinkable immediately."
"Peach, banana peel and a slight petrol note show mildly on the nose. The round palate boasts tart peach, pineapple rind and bitter lemon zest."
"This has aromas that recall leafy underbrush, sawdust and menthol. The dense, oak-driven palate shows licorice, espresso, toast and a hint of bitter chocolate but the fruit has dried up. It abruptly ends on a green note of powdered sage."
"A rose pink colored wine that is dry and with ripe fruit. Its acidity contrasts with the warm red-berry fruit and the edge of tannin. There is a peppery, crisp aftertaste."
"Light strawberry fruit carries an undertone of dried grass. It turns a little sour in the mouth, but it's fine for the price."
"Initial aromas of lychee and jasmine are varietally correct but this struggles to stay fresh and instead turns oily on the nose. A mid-level palate holds nectarine, lychee and oily flavors that turn bitter on the finish."
"The wine is ripe with apple and creamed pear flavors. It is warm, rich and missing acidity. There is an attractive almond and spice character to this ripe wine. Drink now."
"This wine looks, smells and tastes on the light side. Herb and red-cherry aromas precede rather lean flavors from cherry to clove and dill, and a brisk texture with some tannic grip."
"Here is a simple but tasty Chard, offering attractive notes of pear, spiced orange and toasted apple skin on the nose and mouth. It's light weight and well balanced, with ample acidity and a short but clean finish. Enjoy now."
"This is a soft and jammy wine with attractive ripe strawberry fruit and only the lightest structure. It is gentle, rounded and ready to drink."
"This wine is extracted and tough. The acidity does come through to help out, although it still has a hard edge with some bitter toast. It will soften, leaving some perfumed fruit for the future."
"Raisiny and earthy on the nose, this Bonarda also offers damp aromas of fern and tobacco. Chunky, with a soft, flat palate, this tastes raisiny and stewed. Low acidity and raisiny flavors on the finish are consistent with what came before."
"Oily, gritty aromas of almond skins set up a pungent but oily tasting palate. Core fruit flavors lean towards sour grapefruit and orange, while the finish is tangy, salty and sour through the last note."
"A rare miss for this winery, this bottling shows cooked red cherries, dust, vanilla and caramel on the somewhat hollow nose. The palate is almost overly rich with caramelized black cherry, fudge and chalky tannins. Patience will likely improve this one."
"This raspberry-flavored wine is soft and ripe. While it is fruity, it also has a nutty character that gives it a rich taste. It's dry and in a style that will make it better with food than by itself."
"Roasted, stewed berry aromas are rustic and suggestive of grilled meat. This is high in acidity, and thus it feels sharp and edgy. Flavors of forced oak, related spice and tart plum end with a scraping, tannic feel and herbal berry flavors."
"Roasted coffee bean and menthol aromas lead the nose while the evolved palate offers dark bitter chocolate, licorice and a toasted note. Showing the heat of the vintage, the fruit has largely dried up while astringent tannins lead to a bracing finish."
"There seems to be a dusty veil over the fruit of this sold, approachable Sangiovese. A bit of sweet spice creeps up on the palate, making it enjoyable by itself or paired alongside pizza Tuesday."
This light and fruity wine offers soft tannins and an earthy character. The wine comes mainly from Beaujolais with 15% of Pinot Noir from the MÃ¢con region. Drink now.
"This wine has acidity and a good balance between the fresh, crisp character and the richer yellow fruits. It is ready to drink."
"Ripe plum and plenty of vanilla and cherry provide the perception of sweetness in this wine. That sensation may stem from the pushing-the-envelope generosity of the ripe fruit or from the oak. or both. It makes for a full-bodied, heady experience."
"This opens with unusual aromas that recall minestrone soup, celery and glazed onion that carry over to the palate. It lacks fruit richness and is rather muddled, offering flavors reminiscent of sweet and sour sauce. Tasted both bottles, same notes."
"The grape is local to the Vidigueira region of the southern Alentejo. Coming from cool vineyards, the wine has a fresh character that is balanced by the ripe melon and juicy pear fruits. It has a crisper end and is ready to drink."
"Melon and citrus aromas and flavors mingle easily in this cleanly made quaffer. It's a bit plump on the palate, yet refreshing on the lemon-lime finish."
"A nice Pinot Noir, dry and elegant, and if it's somewhat one-dimensional, it packs a lot of flavor. With rich raspberry, red licorice, bacon and spice flavors, it's a lovely wine to drink now."
"The sweet scent of raspberry and strawberry preserves waft from this Cab Franc icewine from Casa Larga. On the palate as well, there's a nice concentration of preserved berry flavors that soar on the palate with a bright, sunny acidity. Finishes clean and long with just a hint of autumn leaves and bramble."
"A soft style of Riesling, with some attractive aromatic white flower character. The fruit is soft, just off dry, freshened by acidity. Screwcap."
"Soft and appealing, this Pinot offers lush, elaborate flavors of raspberry and cherry pie filling, mocha and sandalwood flavors, finished with sweet, dusty Indian spices. It's made for drinking now."
"A little hard at first, with match stick aromas. After that blows off, there's green fruit notes carrying the nose. Full in the mouth, with acidic cut and spunky flavors of nectarine and orange. Finishes round, with citrus and passion fruit."
"Blowsy, lychee aromas, a wine that is ripe, soft, open, with a light touch of acidity. Pepper and sweet spices fit well into this easy profile. Screwcap."
"With brisk Edna Valley acidity and intensely pure Chardonnay fruit flavors of tangerines, limes and sweet Meyer lemon sour candy, this is a pleasant sipper with roasted or grilled salmon, or a barbecue chicken or pork skewer with pineapples, green peppers and onions."
"Pulpy and also minerally on the nose, with basic white fruit aromas. Zesty, crisp and defined by slate and lime in the mouth, with apple, lime and dryness to the flavor profile. A composed little white wine for simple sipping or white sangria."
"Shows the perfect balance and varietal richness that Anderson Valley GewÃ¼rztraminers are known for. With crisp acidity, it has exotic flavors of Asian pears, candied pears, tangerines, gingersnap cookies and dusty spices, with a dry finish. Would score much higher if it were more concentrated."
"A good, rich, flashy Zinfandel. There's not much to get excited about, but it delivers Zin's personality in a most attractive way. It's spicy, rich and sweet in cherry, raspberry, cocoa, honey and spice flavors."
"Funky, with mushroom and sweaty leather aromas that can best be described as Burgundian. But it's richly sweet in raspberries and cherries, and the smoky oak is nicely integrated with the fruit. A pleasant Pinot Noir to drink now."
"This is a dry, elegant young Pinot Noir. It's rich in acidity, and the cherry and cola flavors are sprinkled with zesty white pepper. Seems to be giving its best now."
"A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet."
"The blackberry, blueberry, bacon, pepper and sandalwood flavors are nice, and the wine finishes dry. A good, rich Syrah for drinking now if you're looking for a full-bodied and tannic red wine. Give it a brief decant."
"Cola, root beer and other earthy aromas open up this full-bodied blend of 70% Cabernet and 30% CarmenÃ¨re. The palate shows pointed, prickly acidity and flavors of black cherry and cassis. Offers a rich flavor profile but the acidity creates bite and sharpness."
"Round and good by Rueda standards, with melon and peach aromas but not too much citrus. The palate is full and chunky, with papaya, melon and a touch of pithy bitterness. More regular than special, but good and goes down easy before finishing dry."
"White fruits, flower blossom and a touch of brine work the nose, which is followed by flush, semisweet apple, gooseberry and lime flavors. More sweet than outright tangy, but still citrusy and zesty. Holds form on the crisp finish. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura."
"A touch overripe, showing some bitter, dried raisinskin notes. If you can get past that, you'll find plenty of rich blackberry, dark chocolate, plum, beef jerky and black pepper flavors."
"Ripe enough in blackberries, currants and mocha, with an earthy, tobacco herbaceousness. The tannins are potent, making the wine hard. Drink now, after a good decanting."
"Light, fresh and silkyâ€”just what might be expected from cool-climate Pinot Noir. A pleasant earthiness underscores prettily interwoven strands of herbs and cherries. It's exciting to see the burgeoning quality of the wines coming out of Tasmania."
"Aromas of red licorice candy and raspberry are fruity, forward and clean. The palate is more than competent and balanced, with creamy strawberry and raspberry flavors. The finish is short but easy, and for the price that's all you can ask for."
"A good value in easy-to-drink Cabernet, McWilliam's 2008 is plummy and chocolaty, with soft tannins and a velvety finish. A bit simple perhaps, but definitely satisfying. Drink now."
"Here's a jammy, overtly ripe expression of Aglianico that ultimately proves to be an easier and more immediate expression of this naturally tannic grape variety. Aromas include candied fruit, blackberry preserves, raw cherry and raisin."
"Now with its intensity and some bottle age, this wineâ€”formerly known as CrÃ©mant de Cramantâ€”is rich, with its apple flavor blending with an almond note and a soft, warm texture. The acidity shoots right through this ripe wine."
"A beautiful sparkling wine that shows the Iron Horse signature of balanced elegance. The lime, raspberry, vanilla and brioche flavors are rich and intricate, but particularly lovely is the texture, which is soft and silky."
"Fight your way through the string and wax sealing that holds down the cork, and you'll discover a wine that is rich, full and opulent. The ripe peach character is balanced with the delicious toasty edge and final bright acidity. Ready to drink."
"Powerful and concentrated, this is just at its peak. Ripe, rich fruit and tarry tannins give it freshness and a dry core. It's solid and serious, a dense wine that calls for equally rich food. Drink it now while it's at its prime."
"The Lorna Marie is the winery's reserve, and it has exceptional concentration and depth. Berry and cherry dominate, spiced up with a pumpkin pie accent. Round, rich and full, yet moderate in alcohol, this is a fine expression of Oregon Pinot Noir in a challenging vintage."
"All the 2010 Patton Valley Pinots are significantly lower in alcohol than the previous vintage, and it works to their advantage. Nuanced fruit flavors include rhubarb and tart cherry, with veins of cola and dark chocolate adding further complexity. Its length is excellent."
"The extra age on this bone-dry wine has paid off, as the taut character of a young wine has been tempered with toast, creating a round feeling. It is perfectly in harmony now, beautiful and crisp."
"Verduzzo is a very interesting grape that tends to exude oxidized aromas of candied fruit, butterscotch and carmel. But when made well, as in the case of this selection, it offers power, concentration and natural richness as well."
"The Winderlea is perhaps the most unique in terms of style and flavor among all the 2010 Adelsheim single-vineyard Pinots. Its distinctive minerality accompanies tart cranberry and cherry notes, citrusy acidity with a splash of grapefruit flavor, and a finish that tastes of coffee and tea. Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion."
"This is a powerful, almost concentrated, very dry selection. Its richness comes from the weight of its fruit flavors and the tight tang of its intense acidity. From a fine vintage, it could still age for several more years. Disgorged July 2011."
"Thanks to eight years in Vin Santo's traditional caratelli barrels, this sweet blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia offers a dark, golden-amber color, bearing intense aromas of dried apricot, candied fruit, honey and toasted almond."
"A landmark wine for those who love Italian sparklers, this shows loads of ripe apricot, melon and honey notes, with toasted nut and baked bread hints in the background. There are also touches of caramel and butterscotch that help move the wine's thick and opulent texture across the palate. It ends with refreshing acidity and tonic perlage."
"There's a honeyed accent to this sparkler, with tangerine, lime, buttered toast and yeasty flavors that are savory and complex. The mouthfeel is wonderfully soft and creamy. A great success for Laetitia, at a good price."
"This is dry, rich, heady, spicy and utterly delicious. As usual, it contains a splash of Petite Sirah. Already throwing some sediment, it's pretty tannic, with complex flavors of wild blackberry and blueberry, black currant, licorice, cola, bacon and plum sauce, with a hint of exotic pepper and spice. This great Zinfandel is a joy to drink."
"This mature wine has a soft, smooth character and ripe fruit. With its red-berry flavors and gentle tannins, it's very ready to drink. The blend is dominated by Touriga Nacional from an estate at the heart of the Douro vineyards in PinhÃ£o."
"This is a highly particular, funky blend of 85% Malbec and 15% Cabernet. It opens with savory stewy earthy aromas of berry fruits and prune. Due to the 15.5% abv, this feels heavy and clampy, with rooty flavors of baked berry fruits, cola, minty herbs and carob. An oaky spicy toasty finish with heat is the closing act on this fully stuffed Salta blend."
"A ripe and structured wine, this has bold black fruits and balanced tannins that still need to soften. It has good potential with rich fruits and a tight mineral texture. Drink from 2018."
"Robust black fruit forms around a dense, leathery core of concentration and richness before allowing room for softer, intertwined tannins to add structure and more depth. Chocolate marks the finish of this big, bold wine."
"Oaky, smoky aromas are New World all the way. Heavily toasted and creamy on the palate, this hefty full-bodied Chardonnay tastes of wood resin, spiced apple and peach. Solid acidity keep this in line, while a lasting wave of toasty oak pushes the finish."
"Fragrant notes of tangerine and yuzu peel abound on this citrusy dry Riesling. The palate is cutting and fresh, full of juicy white grapefruit and lime flavors. Light bodied yet satisfyingly thirst quenching, it finishes long with invigorating minerality."
"The variety is unmistakable, with notes of dried herb, dark cherry and espresso. The jammy fruit flavors are rich, with lightly grainy tannins and coffee notes on the finish. It shows a fine sense of balance."
"Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago. It's earthy and scented with a menthol/eucalyptus note, that carries on through. Cranberry flavor reflects the rather low alcohol, but there is no hint of unripeness or any vegetative character."
The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives it structure and aging potential. It is a ripe wine that is also stylish with attractive acidity and plenty of black-currant fruitiness. The wine is developing well and it should be ready to drink from 2018.
"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (66%), Cabernet Sauvignon (20%) and Syrah. The aromas are brooding, with notes of earth, toast, red fruit and spice. The palate brings tart tangy cranberry flavors that linger on the finish."
"The nose of this wine combines this grape's best attributes: bright, crisp citrus redolent in grapefruit and Key lime, but with a tropical touch of guava and pineapple. The palate is broad and ripe but restrained enough, with plush mango and guava laid against a chalky backbone."
"This is the second wine from one of the group of chateaus with Corbin in their names. It is a tight wine, firm with tannins and with a concentrated texture and flavors of over-extraction. That said, the wine will probably develop over time into something serious with a dark, dense aftertaste."
"This is a perfumed wine, with mint flavors as well as blackberry fruits. There is still a dominant structure of tannins and the wood aging that will allow the wine to age well. The fruits give the wine weight while the aftertaste has great swathes of acidity. Drink from 2019."
"Produced from 30-year-old vines, this 55% Cabernet Sauvignon wine is firm with tannins as well as black-currant fruit. It is balanced with the potential to become a fruity wine with a soft texture. The acidity will keep it crisp and on point. Drink from 2018."
"With ripe Merlot dominating this fine, blackberry flavored wine, it is fruity and rich. The acidity gives a crisper edge to the wine while the tannins come from a dry core. It is a wine in progress, full of potential and likely to be ready to drink from 2018."
"This 23-acre-estate is situated in the south of the Margaux appellation, close to classed growth ChÃ¢teau Giscours. While not classified, it still has the ability to produce a fine ripe wine that also has great structure. Acidity and firm tannins are very present along with concentrated blackberry fruits. Drink this fine wine from 2019."
"With black cherry, blueberry, milk chocolate and balsamic reduction offsetting the light dill herbaceousness, this wine offers surprising depth for the affordable price. The texture is soft, yet the tannins stand up to the black cherry, charcoal and black-pepper flavors."
"Made entirely from Syrah grown on its property across multiple vintages, and then cave-aged six years in American oak, this is a nice dessert wine, raisiny and brimming in Christmas spice. With plenty of body and acidity, it swims effortlessly and smoothly on the palate, a bite of decadence that will work well with rich cheeses."
"This is a firm wine, balancing some solid tannins with ripe red fruits. Still young, it is packed with fruitiness and with acidity that are centered around a firm core. Drink this stylish wine from 2018."
"Aromas of savory herbs, mineral, exotic spice and red fruit are followed by fruit flavors that are surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage. Tart acidity livens it up. It's green for the variety but still brings enjoyment."
"The aromas of mineral, spice, toast, yellow apple and lemon pith are light but enchanting. The palate is medium bodied and refined, demonstrating judicious use of oak and a lengthy finish that shows some warmth."
"Bone dry and replete with skin flavors of pear and grapefruit pith, this is perfect for those who want to keep their alcohol consumption down without turning to a sweeter style of wine. Try it with grilled sausages and sauerkraut."
"Very smooth, almost thick, this is a rich wine in flavor and mouthfeel. It practically oozes over the palate, dripping with ripe pineapple, vanilla and cream, and coats every corner of the mouth before lingering through a long finish. It's full bodied, soft and concentrated."
"Without any new oak or lees stirring, this wine's sole focus is on the fruit. Pineapple, melon and peach notes are pure and striking, supported by just hints of vanilla and cream. This medium-bodied Chardonnay finishes in a flurry of tangerine and lime."
"Aromas of ripe orchard fruit and chopped herb jump out of the glass. The savory palate serves up juicy Bartlett pear, green apple, citrus and a mint note while a hint of white almond adds depth. Very appealing."
"Mild raisin, black cherry, anise and burnt tire aromas lead to a plump, balanced palate that's full but not overloaded. Earthy baked black-fruit flavors show a hint of oaky coconut, while this Tempranillo finishes with depth and density."
"This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate. Between the layers are grippy tannins and shakes of meaty leather and black pepper. This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying."
"White blossom perfume accents notes of fresh lemon, lime and green melon in this aromatic Silvaner. While dry in style, it's refreshingly juicy on the palate, bursting with pristine citrus flavor tinged by edges of lime and lemon pith. Mouth filling and rich in texture, it clings lusciously through a long finish."
"This is a particularly expressive wine with lots of personality. It opens with aromas of cherry, tea and wood smoke, and tastes very dry and structured with vivid fruit acidity and tannins. Sour cherry and raspberry provide the fruit flavors."
"Built for early consumption, this blend of 59% Grenache, 22% Shiraz and 19% Mataro is lush and warm, offering chocolaty notes alongside hints of brown sugar, grilled meat and blueberries. Drink nowâ€“2022."
"Aromas of toasted oak, crushed blue flower, underbrush, espresso, licorice and toasted notes take center stage. There's not much fruit richness here so drink now before it fades."
"All from Rosebud Vineyard, this moderately aromatic wine brings notes of herbs and pineapple, with SÃ©millon (15%) adding fig to the mix. The concentration doesn't seem all there and it needs a bit more acid to stand it up."
"While demure on the nose, this light-footed GewÃ¼rztraminer is pretty on the palate with delicate lychee and floral notes. Its unusually nervous and shy for it's variety, but refreshingly quaffable."
"Earthy, lightly stewed aromas of plum and berry set up a lively but pinched and narrow palate with candied flavors of mixed red berry fruits. Additional red-fruit friendliness rolls onto the finish of this pleasant but basic Merlot."
"The wine is warm and round, full of ripe berry fruits and soft tannins. It's ready to drink now with its full structure, balanced acidity and juicy aftertaste."
"Soft, ripe and fruity, this is an immediately accessible, drinkable wine. It's soft with lemon and yellow fruits coming together to give a fresh, lively apÃ©ritif style of wine."
"Cherry and cassis aromas are a touch flat and jammy. This shows grabby tannins as well as loamy, earthy, lightly bitter flavors of black fruits. The finish lumbers along with size and tannic grip, but overall this blend of 65% Tempranillo, 25% Graciano and 10% Garnacha shows well."
"Bready aromas feature melon as the main fruit scent. This is chunky in feel, with moderate acidity and cut. Apple, melon and green-herb flavors finish with hints of toast, yeast and generic sweetness."
"This displays evident oak sensations of sweet vanilla, toast, espresso, milk chocolate and mature black plum alongside drying tannins. There's not much fresh acidity so drink soon before it dries out."
"Grape soda, prune, leather, graphite, dust and black tobacco blend into an intriguing nose on this estate Malbec from Paso's Eastside. It's a little rustic around the edges once sipped, but pleasantly so. The mouthfeel is soft, the flavors are peppery and the tannins and acidity are built to last."
"Nothing is out of place in this solid, attractive and well-priced Merlot. It is a straightforward red wine that feels well-balanced, is medium to full-bodied, and has tasty, mellow plum and cherry flavors. Firm tannins mark the clean finish."
"Roasted coffee bean, underbrush, toast and allspice lead the nose on this big wine. The one-dimensional palate offers dense cherry extract, licorice and the warmth of alcohol. It's already evolved so drink now."
"This wine brings together sensations of tilled earth, espresso, oak extract, coffee, overripe black plum and vanilla. The palate displays tightly packed tannins but it's low on fresh acidity so drink it soon."
"Leathery, briny plum aromas are full and herbal. This feels solid and medium in size and body. Flavors of earthy, roasted berry and plum finish lightly green and herbal, with a touch of sweetness."
"Chenin Blanc has found an unlikely new home in Cahors, to judge by the producers who are trying it out. It works well, giving a deliciously nutty character as well as intense citrus and minerality. Age this wine until 2015."
"A clean, fresh wine, this opens with crisply varietal aromatics of citrus and orange blossom. The flavors follow suit, adding some fresh-cut pineapple as well; then the wine hits a wall and simply pulls up short."
"Crisp while also fruity, it has bright acidity, lively citrus and apple flavors and a refreshing aftertaste. Drink now."
Some wood aging gives the fruitiness of the wine an added spice. Tannins support the bitter cherry flavors and add firmness to the juicy acidity. Drink from the end of 2015.
"The wine is very fresh, with intense acidity and fragrant red fruits. Made from 100-year-old vines, it's tight, mineral and has a cool, light character with the merest hint of tannin. Drink now."
"Aromas of a closed cellar blow off in the glass to reveal underbrush, violet, woodland berries and a hint of white pepper that all carry over to the palate. It's one-dimensional with fresh acidity and would work well with deep-dish pizza covered with toppings."
"Briary, spicy, mildly herbal berry aromas give way to a full, bold, wiry feeling palate with pointed acidity. Herbal, lightly green flavors of tobacco and plum finish crisp."
"Attractive cherry flavors give a ripe, rounded feel that's balanced by the acidity and tannins. Black cherries burst easily from the glass, delivering a full aftertaste."
"Apple and melon aromas are standard and light. A juicy, citrusy feeling palate delivers stone-fruit flavors of peach and nectarine. A mild finish is fresh in flavor and feel."
"Generic white-fruit and matchstick aromas are quiet in nature. This is creamy and not assaulting or sugary on the palate. Mango, melon, lychee and citrus flavors finish with lime notes."
"Despite the abv listed, this wine does not seem especially ripe. Peppery highlights carry a whiff of onion, and between the alcohol burn and the green edges, the wine has not come together. Aging in 40% new oak adds some toast, but not grip or density."
"Blossoms and yellow cherries lend a sweet floral flair on the nose of this dry Riesling. It's straightforward in style, but quaffable and refreshing, with flavors of fresh apple and pear that finish crisp and clean."
"This is a rich style of rosÃ©, rounded and fruity with good texture, wild strawberry flavors and very crisp acidity at the end. It's an attractive wine and one that's worth keeping until 2015."
"This does a good job of balancing lively pear and apple flavors with dashes of toast and butter. It's medium to full-bodied, dry and has enough crispness to help the flavors linger."
"While the wine has a crisp side, it's also full of red fruits and soft tannins. That makes for a wine that's fragrant, fruity, ready to drink and not likely to age much. Enjoy it now."
"Aged for 20 months in 40% new French oak, this remains a tough nut to crack. It's encased in a hard tannic shell, with little ripe fruit, and is strongly flavored with barrel notes of tobacco and vanilla. Decant it or put it through an aerator."
"Aromas of citrus, white stone fruit and a vegetal hint suggesting tomato leaf lead the way. The racy palate offers grapefruit, pineapple, fresh white peach and flinty mineral while a pleasantly bitter note closes the finish."
"Fragrant and fresh, this Grillo opens with alluring scents of acacia flower, beeswax and white stone fruit. The succulent palate offers creamy white peach, juicy nectarine, almond and mineral framed in tangy acidity. A note of chopped herb closes the lingering finish."
"A soft, stony scent of pebble and the faintest melon signals a fresh, clean wine. The palate plays these aromas out softly but also with precision. That stoniness lingers on the dry, gentle finish and the lasting flavor of fresh apple peel"
"The Pinot-ness of this wine is undeniable: its structure is of velvet, and its aromas convey freshly turned earth, autumnal oak leaf and subdued red-cherry fruit. There is a depth that evokes deep forests. Have this with furred or feathered game."
"With tannins and new-wood flavors, this rich wine is also structured. A smoky character from the wood is shot through by perfumed red fruits. The aftertaste shows more of the wood flavors that need to integrate. Drink from 2018."
"This is a blend from most parts of the village, with fruit from 14 different parcels. It is solid and firm while also having great swathes of raspberries and red plums laced together with acidity. The aftertaste is perfumed with a fresh lift. Drink from 2018"
"Young vines, planted in 2007, give a fresh, fruity wine with attractive citrus and zingy orange flavors. It is ripe and deliciously perfumed with a touch of minerality and saltiness. Drink from 2019."
"With intense acidity, this wine has both good structure and red currant and raspberry fruits. It is bright, fresh and almost crisp in character. In the background, the tannins show the dense texture of the wine. It will need to age, so don't drink before 2019."
"Bruised apple and dandelion notes play spicily on the textured, slightly phenolic palate. The central streak of freshness brightens all aspects of the wine, which might gain complexity with a year or two more in bottle. For now it remains intriguingly poised between earthy richness and ethereal lift."
"A dusting of crushed slate and saffron accents this zesty lime and honey kissed Kabinett. It's dancingly light on the palate, but concentrated with swirls of marmalade and orange-peel flavors that extend through a long finish. Drink now through 2025."
"An interesting vein of tasty herb flavor runs through this full-bodied, plump and fruity wine. The aroma has hints of dill and sage, and these mingle with black cherry and blueberry on the palate. A sleek texture and long finish complete the picture."
"Quite buttery and nutty on the nose, this wine shows Marcona almonds, seared pineapple, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and vanilla custard. Those elements meet with smart amounts of acid and texture on each creamy, buttery, pineapple-laced sip, which then finishes on marshmallow flavors."
"Scents of pressed white flower, orchard fruit, smoke, citrus and a whiff of nut lead the nose on this savory white. The round, medium-bodied palate offers mature pear, pineapple, peach and hazelnut while a note of flinty mineral lifts the finish."
"Tar and beef char kick off the nose on this dark and heavy wine, which offers asphalt, smoked meats and crushed elderberry. Caramelized beef, balsamic-blackberry reduction, tobacco and touches of smoke show on the palate."
"Fresh cut pear fruit flavors carry this wine. It's crisp and clean, with fresh fruit balanced against natural acidity. Drink it now while the freshness is paramount."
"This is a generous, leathery and tannic wine, full-bodied and made in a juicy, foreboding style. Black pepper, leather and cigar smoke provide a sultry, robust edge to the wine, which should cellar well, through 2020."
"Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release. The elderberry fruit is hung on a strong tannic structure, bolstered by woody cigar box, incense, juniper and espresso flavors."
"Pressed wild flower, hay, fennel and ripe berry scents mingle together in the glass. The refreshing palate combines crushed strawberry, juicy red cherry, saline and a hint of baking spice alongside bright acidity."
"Alluring scents of Spanish broom, iris, berry and a hint of dried herb come together on this. The bright palate offers candied cherry, nectarine zest, white pepper and a hint of fennel while a mineral note signals the finish."
"Lighter bramble and red-currant fruits pop on the nose of this wine from the appellation's eastern end, as do baking-spice notes, crushed vanilla and hibiscus. It's airy on the palate, with tense cranberry and pomegranate, crushed oregano and dill, pencil lead minerality and a slowly simmering acidity."
"Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of FrÃ¼hburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir. Blackberry and plum flavors are fleshy and rich, offset by soft, sunny acidity and a supple silken mouthfeel. It's just faintly tannic and approachable now."
"This offers heady aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit, dill, hay and a vegetal note that recalls tomato leaf. The tangy palate offers juicy grapefruit, white peach and honeydew melon while mouthwatering salinity provides depth."
"This is ripe, rich and even a touch tannicâ€”almost more of a light red than a true rosÃ©. This makes it ideally suited to serve alongside summer's various grilled meats. Raspberry and cola flavors finish spicy and round."
"Fresh fruit flavors suggest a bowl full of berries and cherries. Crisp acids help to focus the wine, with spot-on varietal flavors and balance. Both elegant and complex, it's a lovely bottle from an under-the-radar producer."
"Composed berry, spice, herb and oak aromas are complete and inviting. In the mouth, this is ripe and dense, with chewy tannins. Blackberry, mixed herb and dark chocolate flavors are integrated, while this settles nicely on the finish."
"The most reserved of this winery's Grenache studies, this bottling shows baked red cherry, red currant, cola and slate on the nose. An iron-based minerality shows on the earthy palate, which also offers chipped slate, cranberry and tart cherry elements. It's a tad light but still intriguingly textured."
"This is an amazingly tasty and focused wine that has the most distinctive black pepper character. It's medium-bodied, dark and smoky looking and quite flavorful, backing up the pepper with lively raspberry notes and staying lively from the first sip to the last."
Chocolate and blackberry form an impressively generous and full-bodied personality in this 100% varietal wine aged 22 months in a hearty percentage of new oak. Big tannin and traces of cigar and espresso continue on the brawny theme.
"Not such a rarity these days, AlbariÃ±o is turning heads in California and Oregon. This tart, juicy, and deliciously fresh effort is loaded with tangy citrus and green apple fruit. It's leesy and textural, tasting of wet stones: in sum, a wonderfully refreshing summer white."
"This delicate Hungarian white wine is a blend of 86% Furmint, 9% Yellow Muscat and 5% Kabar. It has enticing aromas of white flowers, botrytis, gardenia, apple blossom and apricot that prepare your palate for flavors of peach juice, citrus zest, grapefruit juice, caramelized pineapple and a crisp clean finish."
"SousÃ£o gives intense color and that, along with its attractive perfume, makes a dense, intensely fruity wine. It is rich and weighty, the tannins well integrated with a ripe, juicy aftertaste."
"The latest release from the partnership between the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto in the Douro and the Cazes family of ChÃ¢teau Lynch-Bages in Bordeaux. The wine brings out considerable minerality, a herbal edge along with forward black currant fruit. It is austerely structured at this stage and needs aging for several years."
"Ripe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine. Still, it's a heavyweight to drink now through 2013."
"Here's an elegant and clean blend of Merlot (50%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc from coastal Tuscany that offers intensity and well-measured aromas of ripe cherry, espresso bean and tobacco. The wine is plush and soft, with plump berry notes on the finish."
"Full-bodied wine, spiced with nutmeg and toast and give richness by sweet blackberry juice flavors. It is densely structured, rich with great fruit character as well as a powerful drive of rich tannins. Age this wine at least four years and more."
"A solid effort, with attractive, balanced black currant fruits and ripe acidity. The wine layers fruit and integrated tannins. It feels chunky and dense, finishing dry."
"Impressive for its depth and deliciousness. The grapes are from Cline's estate on the Sonoma side of the Carneros district. The wine is dry, full-bodied and tannic, although you can drink it now. It's very rich in blackberries, currants, mushu plum sauce, grilled beef and smoky sandalwood, and seems at its best now."
"Ripe black fruit aromas aren't overly complex or nuanced but they are generous. Feels tight, gritty and healthy, with firm tannins in front of black cherry and blackberry flavors. Mellows on the finish, where plum and prune flavors take over. Not a hard, fierce Priorat; drink now through 2014."
"Here's a big, rich, fruity Cabernet that satisfies for its array of blackberry, cherry, currant, mineral and oak flavors. It's dry and tannic, and the overall quality is quite high. The price makes it a good Buy. Drink through 2014"
"This elegant 80-20 Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers mature aromas of ripe berry, black cherry and fresh aromas of dried herbs and powdered licorice. The somewhat subdued bouquet leads to a generous mouthfeel that leaves a long-lasting impression."
"Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly. Shows ripe, flashy raspberry, strawberry, orange, vanilla, honey, yeast and toast flavors, and the mouthfeel is silky and refined."
"So soft, silky and sweet in blackberries, cherries and red currants, it could be a big, ripe Pinot Noir. That's a compliment. Petite Sirah can often be overpowering. This one's delicate, elegant and frankly delicious. Best now and over the next four years."
"This Grenache-heavy blend (with 20% Syrah) offers a good amount of bittersweet cocoa powder and rich jammy black berries and all-fruit preserves on the nose and mouth. A hint of gaminess adds interest to the bouquet, while the crushed velvet texture and firm tannins transition into a long finish laced with earthy spice."
"Aromas of fresh-cut hay lead to a wine that has considerable concentration and good balance from wood aging. Very citrus with pineapple touches, it finishes with an herbaceous feel. The wine comes from a vineyard planted at the end of the 19th century."
"A complex mix of wild berry, cherry and somewhat brambly fruits provides a substantial core to this wine. The fruit rolls on through a slightly chalky patch, then finishes with a flourish of toast and graphite."
"A rich, tasty Pinot, packed with black cherry pie filling, cola, orange zest, star anise, cinnamon and sandalwood flavors that finish sweet and long. The texture is satisfying. Drink over the next several years."
"If you like your Voigniers flamboyant, this one's for you. It's an explosion of tangerines, golden mangoes, peaches and pears, with buttery, creamy overtones and a finish of honey. Lots of zesty acidity adds a balancing scour to the mouthfeel."
"Delicious is the word that comes to mind drinking this Pinot Noir. It's young and vibrant in acidity, with waves of raspberries, persimmons, honey, cinnamon, cloves and smoky sandalwood. Good over the next five years."
"A riot of licorice, cassis, toast and berry, this 83% Cabernet Sauvignon/17% Petit Verdot Bordeaux-style blend is currently showing a lot of barrel flavors, with subdued but not insignificant fruit. Medium-grained tannins give the finish some gravitas."
"This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink nowâ€“2018."
"Jacopo Biondi Santi hits a home run with this beautiful Morellino. The wine is smooth and dense, with lively cherry notes, soft spice and tobacco. It's straightforward and plush, but elegant at the same time."
"Le Buche is an interesting winery to watch, and its various Tuscan blends show great promise. Memento is equal parts Sangiovese and Syrah with a soft, velvety texture and a bright berry finish."
"Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Mighty and impressive."
"Dusty and tight, with a whiff of coffee and cocoa introducing an elegant wine with interesting streaks of metal and graphite. Young fruit and fine tannins are in perfect balance, and the wine has a lovely delicacy."
"This vintage of Marsiliana (the top wine from the Maremma property of Prince Corsini) shows rich tones of espresso, chocolate, dark fruit, leather and spice. The wine is soft and well extracted, with a slightly tough, chewy finish."
"Tuscany's Mazzei family delivers a wonderful Chianti Classico from their Fonterutoli estate that would pair perfectly with grilled meats or oven-roasted pasta. This is a soft, lush wine with bright cherry and spice notes, which drive a long, velvety finish."
"It has taken a few years but Morlanda has reached a nice place with this wine. Look for ripeness and concentrated black fruit aromas, and then a ripe palate with herbal blackberry and chocolate. Smooth on the finish, with a tiny bit of burn. Drink now through 2014."
"A wood-aged white, spicy and ripe. It has just the right balance of acidity to go with the ripe green plum and melon fruits. With a great bite of acidity to finish, this is a wine that will age for 3â€“4 years."
"White lily, popcorn kernel, citrus spray and underripe peach lead the well-integrated and restrained nose. The palate follows suit, remaining quiet and delicate in flavor concentration, yet loud in weight and texture. Salty citrus lingers on the finish."
"Whiffs of smoke and nuts mingle into tart tangerine and lime flavors in this refreshing off-dry Riesling. Juicy and fresh, it's a straightforward, revitalizing sip. Drink now through 2018."
"Aromas of leather, vineyard dust, dried violet and a whiff of pressed powder lead the nose. The simple palate isn't very expressive, showing sour red cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside close-grained tannins that dry out the finish."
"An enticing mix of dark berries and fatty, cured sausage makes for an interesting nose. There's good structure and balance on the palate with this southern Italian transplant. It's juicy, ripe and ready for barbecue."
"Peach, canned tropical fruit and white flower aromas are pristine on the nose. The medium-bodied palate shows a balance of juicy peach and pineapple, with streaks of chalk and a vein of acidity. This is clean, succinct and perfectly enjoyable on its own."
"A fresh lemon-flavored wine with crisp acidity balanced by warmer white-stone fruit. It is fruity, showing a touch of toast and almonds. Drink now."
"The nose isn't very expressive, offering aromas of toasted hazelnut, while the dense, simple palate shows dried black cherry and licorice. It's shy on freshness and has round but rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2018."
"This opens with aromas of toast, oak, menthol, resin, coffee bean and medicinal notes. The aromas carry over to the firm palate, along with thyme, clove, licorice and bracing tannins."
"Flat in color, with a dull luster, this smells mulchy and earthy, with dampness to the nose. A thick, medicinal palate is dealing severe tannins embedded into a syrupy texture. Flavors of fig, raisin and earth are a little spent."
"Juicy dark plum, cherry and boysenberry are upfront on the nose, with additional seductive hints of purple violet and vanilla. The palate is plush and fruit-forward, with ample acidity and medium tannins that lend pleasant structure. Accents of sweet spice grace the finish."
"This light, refreshing rosÃ© mixes fresh strawberry fruit with apple-flavored acids. It's finished bone dry, with an almost dusty mouthfeel (in a good kind of way)."
"Amber in color, this wine has aromas of peach jam and orange blossom. Flavors are a mÃ©lange of mellow fruit and savory notes, in particular apricot, lemon curd, quince and bitter almond. Despite strong tannins, there are moments of brightness across the entire palate that linger into the finish."
"Smashed berry aromas are backed by earth and toasty oak notes. Fairly hard and tannic on the palate, this shows herbal plum flavors in front of a bold finish with dry tannins and a hint of wood spice."
"This is smooth and accessible, putting a light chocolate frame around rhubarb and strawberry fruit. There's a hint of pepper, and the wine is fresh and youthful, good sipping wine for late summer/early fall."
"Quite tart, the fruit here touches (just barely) on melon, with orange and lemon zest, a bit of lime, and plenty of acid. All stainless fermented, it went through full malolactic."
"This has aromas suggesting grilled herb, toasted oak, espresso and a whiff of wet animal fur. The palate offers dried cherry, game, anisette and a green note of bitter sage alongside extremely astringent tannins."
"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of sawdust. The bracing palate offers dried cherry, espresso and mocha alongside astringent tannins. Give the tannins another year or two to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit."
"Despite looking gold and mature, this PG exceeds expectations courtesy of waxy, baked-apple aromas and a full but balanced mouthfeel. Spiced apple, apricot and burnt orange flavors finish long due to core acidity. Drink immediately."
"Green beans and snap peas give this Sauvignon Blanc a green cast overall, but there's some citrus and gooseberry fruit as well. It's clean and refreshing on the finish."
"A blend of FernÃ£o Pires and Arinto, this is totally crisp and refreshingly fruity. It is perfumed, smooth while also cut with acidity. The acidity comes from both citrus and pineapple flavors. Drink now."
"Aromas of citrus and petrol are backed by a juicy palate with tangy acidity and semisharp flavors of peach, tangerine and stone-fruit pits. Fresh, citrusy length and a lingering note of orange are the finish."
"Known in Spain as Graciano, this grape produces attractive, fruity wine especially in the Tejo region. This example is ripe with layers of acidity as well as a generous texture. Soft and smooth, it is ready to drink."
"This medium-bodied wine features aromas of green apple and crushed stone, while the flavors turn citrusy, veering toward lime and grapefruit. It's nicely silky in texture, while a hint of snow pea marks the finish."
"An earthy, nutty aroma and flavor come through the intense sweetness and full body of this dessert-style wine. It goes for earthy complexity rather than obvious fruit flavors, and tastes high in sugar and alcohol."
"This Malbec is a collection of disparate parts that doesn't justify its price. Reduced plum and grapy berry aromas come with woodsy notes of menthol and cola. Highly herbal, saucy, savory flavors are more oaky than fruity, while this finishes with muscular tannins and savory, grapy notes."
"This is crisp and fresh medium-sweet wine. It is bright with red-currant acidity and ripe with a strawberry and cream flavor. The wine is clean, lively and, of course, ready to drink."
"Cellar floor, eucalyptus, black spice and a note recalling grilled celery lead the nose. The ripe palate offers mature black cherry, star anise and a hint of orange zest while assertive, tightly knit tannins leave an astringent finish."
"This full-bodied wine is in the classic mode, offering very ripe and even overripe aromas. Voluptuous berry flavors verge on sweet, and the rich texture comes without a lot of drying tannin."
"Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much."
"Berry, menthol and a hint of espresso aromas lead the way while the straightforward palate shows mature black-skinned berry, coffee and a hint of licorice. It's already approachable. Drink through 2020."
"The wood flavors are still prominent in this spicy wine. Heavily influenced by rich Merlot, the wine is lightly structured and more about juicy red fruits. Tannins in the back give enough shape, although it will be ready to drink from early 2017."
"While the wine is firm and tannic at this early stage, it does have the potential to bring out a more fruity character. The red-berry fruits and acidity are there, promising a fresh wine from 2018."
"Ripe fruit and balanced acidity allow this wine to make room for touches of wood aging. It has spice, a smoky character and attractive finishing freshness. Drink from 2017 when the wine will be fully balanced."
"From a estate in the Marmet family since 1990, the wine has ripe Merlot flavors that give a generous character. Big, bold fruitiness dominates this wine whose structure is firm while smooth. Drink starting from 2019."
"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the woodâ€”31% new and 26% once-usedâ€”seems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening."
"This is a pleasant white wine, albeit rather generic, as Pinot Blanc is prone to be. Crisp apple flavors and a touch of grapefruit are the focus. Drink chilled and enjoy it while it's still young and fresh."
"Earthy, cool aromas of wet cement, raisin and raspberry are a bit flat. This feels drawing and tannic, with flavors of tomato, red plum, currant and raspberry. A full-size finish is comfortable but not very complex."
"This wine puts jammy aromas, very ripe flavors, full body and deep, dark fruit flavors on a broad, soft texture."
"Neatly divided between the three major grapes of Champagne, this full, ripe wine is packed with rich apple and pear fruits. It is crisp while showing a high dosage giving a softer, smoother aftertaste. Drink this bottling now."
"Cool aromas of cola, leather and black cherry set up a fairly full but fresh palate with moderate creamy weight. This tastes reedy and spicy, with wild-berry fruit, peppery notes and a distinct flavor of creamy oak. On the finish, this is oaky and herbal tasting."
"Stewy plum and cherry jam lie at the heart of this densely layered, though silky-smooth wine, light bodied and ethereal despite the ripeness of fruit flavor. It finishes simply and without fuss."
"Slightly gritty aromas are just barely ripe enough. This feels tight, acidic and like tomato juice. Flavors of salty berry fruits, tomato, oak and vanilla are modest but complete. Given how cool 2013 was in Rioja, this is quite good."
"Sharply defined, this has piercing, penetrating high notes that are both floral and fruity. Its lemon and tangerine fruit is amped up with some alcoholic burn. Aerating it helps to smooth it out."
"Director's sources from vineyards across the county to offer an intensity of fruit flavor that tends lush and ripe. Melon and vanilla appear on the nose and palate, with a side tone of pineapple, nutmeg and even clove, finishing clean and with simplicity."
"Small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah are blended within this wine, given 17 months in new French oak plus once and twice-used barrels. The oak is integrated within this otherwise leathery, tannic and mild-mannered wine, ripe in cherry and cassis."
"Just lightly touched by wood this is a bright and fruity wine that is ready to drink. Spice and red-berry fruits dominate, lifted by balanced tannins. Drink now."
"It is the 30% Alicante Bouschet in the blend that gives the dense color to this ripe wine. Concentrate and rich, the generous berry flavors are balanced by a more restrained acidity and smoky flavors. The wine is ready to drink."
"Fragrant and fresh, this easy-drinking red has alluring scents of woodland berry, violet and a whiff of freshly tilled soil. The taut, luminous palate offers sour cherry and star anise accompanied by polished tannins and racy acidity."
"With a richness to the nose, this wine possesses a medium-sized body and moderate acidity, showcasing ripe apple, pear and tropical elements. The finish is focused in simple notions of preserved lemon and pineapple."
"This is a highly structured wine with an abundance of fine-grained tannins and firm acidity to support pure raspberry and blackberry flavors. It tastes as if it was made for aging, so wait and drink after 2019."
"Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine."
"This new â€œiâ€ series offering mixes brambly strawberry fruit with granular tannins. It's ready to drink, dappled with cinnamon, and leaves a slightly medicinal aftertaste in the back of the mouth."
"Full-bodied and smooth in texture, this generous-tasting wine has lots of ripe plum flavors and sweet-seeming oak accents."
"This offers scents and flavors that recall stewed prune, raisin and black pepper. It's still tight, with aggressive tannins that leave a firm clenching finish. Give it a few years to let the tannins unfurl then drink up to capture the remaining fruit."
"Here's a fun, informal sparkler that has aromas of citrus, orchard fruit and toast. The racy palate shows golden apple, pear, bitter almond and a lemon drop note."
"The great Ritchie Vineyard, a renowned site for Chardonnay, also possesses highly sought-after Sauvignon Blanc. Here, it shows as grassy in pea shoots and thick, with a voluptuous texture and body weight."
"Crisp plum and red-bell-pepper aromas lead to a healthy, mostly fresh palate with some weight to it. A mix of citrus and red-plum flavors ends long, without much, if any, unwanted pithiness or bitterness."
"Partially from Grand Cru vineyards in the Montagne de Reims and the CÃ´te des Blancs, this wine is soft, ripe and balanced, with a ripe dosage that contrasts with citrus acidity. It has a fine, cool texture."
"This is a fragrant, spicy wine that is shot through with red fruits and fine acidity. The 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is still firm with its tannins although the acidity and bright fruit are well in balance. Drink from 2018."
This is a ripe wine and full of fruit. It has structure as well with its firm tannins and smoky backdrop. It will broaden out well and give a rich wine from 2018.
"A balanced wine, with softness that indicates a relatively high dosage. There is no complexity, but the wine is light, creamy, flavored with green plums and kiwi, just edged with bitterness."
"From a large 177-acre estate in the southern Graves, this wine shows plenty of stalky, black currant fruits, fresh acidity and spice from wood. It has just the right characters for a food Bordeaux, dry core of tannins and vivid fruit around."
"Here's a Trebbiano-based wine from the Lake Garda area in northern Italy that delivers smooth consistency and expressive notes of stone fruit, citrus, honey and crushed stone. The wine would pair well with lake fish or vegetable dishes."
"Packaged in a heavy, oversized black bottle, this brawny wine delivers power, bulging muscle and aromas that exaggerate in every way possible. The most noticeable feature (so noticeable, it knocks you in the face) is the wood element that comes off as fresh carpentry or wood shavings. The wine is heavy, syrupy and sweet tasting."
"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased. Kono's 2008 is on the light side, but tart and zippy, with a refreshing aspect to its pineapple and grapefruit flavors and herbal overtones. Drink now."
"Light and tropical, with buttercup aromas and a touch of citrus. The palate is plump and slightly oily, but with good acidity. Apple, mango and banana flavors are fruity and sweet, but overall the wine holds it together. Drink right away."
"Corvina, Rondinella and Dindarellaâ€”three grapes native to the Verona area of Northern Italyâ€”make up this fresh and lively, easy-sipping rosÃ©. The wine awards pretty aromas of raspberry and white cherry."
"Good introductory CarmenÃ¨re. It's a touch green, which is common for this quality level, but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through. Lively and clanky on the palate, with red fruit, bramble and herbal snap. Good if you're not expecting too much."
"A little tough and gritty, but okay for everyday fare. Shows blackberry, currant, tobacco and herb flavors that turn sweetly fruity on the finish."
"Although it is labeled â€œExtra Dryâ€ (that is sweeter than Brut), this lively Champagne in its festive little pink bottle is very fresh, with delicious acidity. It finishes lightly, easily."
"Sweet in jammy apricots and pineapples, with even richer notes of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity fortunately provides some balance. From Venge Vineyards."
"A bit earthy and herbal, and soft, with cherry and cocoa fruit flavors. The acidity and tannin structure could be firmer."
"It's soft, slightly oxidized, and generic. It's pleasantly quaffable, marked in the finish by some rather bitter toast."
"Fabio Sireci is behind some of Sicily's best Nero d'Avola and has more recently decided to flex his winemaker muscle on Pinot Noir. The results are a tad jammy and muddled (his vineyards are smack in the middle of the Mediterranean island), ending with ripe aromas of prune and raisin."
"Clean and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus, pear, green apple, vanilla and honey. Finishes with that well-known K-J sweetness. A blend based on Sauvignon Blanc."
"Sweet and simple, with pleasantly exotic flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, minerals, spices, vanilla, brown sugar and smoky oak. Easy to drink."
"A little on the sweet side, but crisp in acidity, and front-loaded with pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle and spicy vanilla flavors. Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Blanc, Chardonnay and Roussanne."
"A heavy dose of Sauvignon Blanc brings herbaceous, grassy, white currants and gooseberry flavors. It's young, and needs more time to coalesce. It is certainly fresh, fruity, right up front."
"This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition."
"This totally fresh wine has benefited from the quality of whites in 2007 Bordeaux. It is lemony with pink grapefruit flavors giving an intense lift. There is some herbaceousness, with green herbs and juicy fruits. To drink now."
"This is a northern Italian Cabernet with a light, informal style and low intensity. The wine delivers measured aromas of cherry, pine, cedar and ends with a crisp note of acidity."
"Off-dry, with sugary flavors of apricots, pears, flowers, vanilla and dusty Asian spices. Crisp acidity provides needed balance. Try with Vietnamese, Thai or Burmese fare."
"An intriguing nose of tobacco, mint, cherry and spice leads this earthy red. Flavors of spice, tobacco, red berry and tea are supported by ageable tannins and good complexity."
"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go."
"This is a sweet, rich Port. Its aromas are of soft berry jelly, with a ripe herbal character. To taste, it is concentrated, but the sweetness of the fruit masks its density. Berry and dried fruits make an attractive blend, leaving a firmer structure in the aftertaste."
"While lacking the vibrant fruit typical of the variety, there are some attractive hay and honey scents on nose. The full-bodied and soft-textured palate is cloaked in vanilla, which lingers on the finish."
"This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made."
"Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines."
"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese."
"A remarkably rich, spicy, attractive red. It obviously has new wood, but its use is judicious, leaving the mint, black berry and soft tannins of the fruit to come through well."
"Made from Fer Servadou, Duras and Syrah, this is a wine with a truly local pedigree and a modern style, with prominent new wood. There are aromas that talk of wild heather and a dry landscape and palate notes of spice, ripe berries and prunes."
"A delicious wine, the Chenin Blanc giving both mineral and spice flavors, contrasting with the richer Chardonnay. Apricot and sweet melon flavors are supported by a fine, surprisingly complex structure. Fresh currants mark the refreshing finish."
"An enticingly perfumed wine, with its white flowers and apricot blossom. The palate is soft, rich, moving towards yellow fruits, ripe pink grapefruit and just an edge of mineral chalkiness."
"EdÃ¨lmio is a sophisticated and toasty blend of Carricante and Chardonnay with fragrant aromas of stone fruit, peach, mineral, almond and freshly chopped pear. The wine is broad and generous in terms of its mouthfeel and would make a perfect companion to swordfish with mint and roasted eggplant."
"Here's a Syrah with bursting aromas of mature blueberry, cherry, spice and smoked bacon. The wine is full, round and generous with a supple feel and soft concentration. Pair it with lamb or roasted pork."
"Blended from a patchwork of old vineyards throughout the Barossa, this is typical Barossa Shiraz, with plenty of weight and creamy tannins that support plummy, chocolaty fruit. There's a bit of spice for complexity and a crisp, fresh finish. Drink nowâ€“2014."
"Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion. It's a bit heavier than the previous vintage, with less of the floral character, but it offers, instead, a richness that lingers into a satisfying finish."
"Creamy and textural, this brings on a nice mix of apple, pear and Key lime fruit flavors, fresh and pretty. Just a hint of minerality adds interest to the finish."
"Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part. Still young, give it some time in a decanter or in your cellar to come together and show its best."
"Nerello Mascalese, a grape native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna, delivers fresh berry notes that recall raspberry, blueberry and mulberry backed by toasted almond. There are pretty mineral nuances woven within its texture and the wine ends with polished tannins and menthol freshness. It is aged 12 months in oak, but you hardly taste the wood."
"Aromas of cherry, spice and mint lead into tart pie cherry and wild berry fruit, dusted with cocoa and spiced up with 16 months in French oak barrels. Unusual for most high-end Pinots, this is sealed with a screwcap."
The richness of vintage 2003  shows in this wine's layers of dried fruits on top of sweet tannins and a dense concentration. There is some licorice flavor arriving as the wine matures.
"Full, firm white wine that gives good green fruit and pear flavors, lifted with spice from wood. The wine is round, while still retaining crispness from grassy acidity, and offers a good depth of plum skin structure and flavor."
"A full, soft Sauvignon from close to Sancerre. There is a light, yeasty character to this young wine, but the fruit is all thereâ€”fresh pink grapefruit, lime and green berries. The finish is acidic and crisp, but still mouth-filling."
"This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits. The spicy elements wrap into all the other flavors, giving lift and life; this is an exciting wine, though not necessarily one to cellar."
"Concentrated, with white fruits, a strong streak of herbaceousness, green apples and a rich texture. The wine shows intensity as well as youth. It really needs another year before drinking."
"Intense and focused, this good value Coonawarra opens with notes of leather and polished wood overlaid with red-berry fruit. Tannins are smooth, but there's plenty of lip-smacking acidity to keep the cherry cordial and plum fruit flavors lively. Drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA."
"Denser and less herbal than the 2005 Gran Reserva, with fresh cassis and plum fruit to go with some chocolaty overtones. This has plenty of intensity and structure."
"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tartâ€”red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole."
"Unusually fruity for a Pinot Gris, this bursts with quince, hay and lanolin aromas that give way to an intense palate with good weight. While slightly astringent, the mouthwatering finish will provide a good foil for fried calamari."
"This ruby-hued blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio conveys aromas of bright berry, intense mint and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, mineral and cinnamon flavors alongside fresh acidity."
"Aromas suggest oak, vanilla, bell pepper and cassis. The palate offers black cherry, cranberry, vanilla, mocha and oak alongside astringent, drying tannins."
"This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas. The palate is driven by pine sap, charred game and sharp herbs such as oregano and rosemary, and would be a great way to spice up a steak dinner."
"A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins."
"Aromas of ripe dark berry, blue flower and a hint of baking spice waft from the glass. On the palate, notes of graphite, licorice and touch of smoke add depth to the ripe black cherry flavors. Firm tannins provide support."
"Citrus, yellow apple, orange blossom and saline aromas take center stage. On the palate, notes of savory herb accent creamy apple and pear flavors that are brightened by fresh acidity and a mineral note."
"This wine is still young, showing spice and not yet enough fruit. It has the right weight and potential richness as well as concentration from the old vines. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2016."
"Estate bottled, this assemblage of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot opens with a flurry of coconut flake and herb, followed by ripe, rich layers of dark berry and black tea. The wine has power yet also possesses an elegance that stands out, finishing with a taste of dark caramel."
"Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle."
"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold. This chunky Malbec is tannic and grabby, with oaky flavors of black plum and vanilla set against herbal undertones. Spice, chocolate, carob and drawing tannins create a bold but rough finish."
"Made entirely with Insolia, this opens with subdued aromas of tropical fruit and white spring flower. The bright, linear palate offers passion fruit, peach, nectarine zest and a hint of ginger alongside crisp acidity."
"This offers aromas of honeydew melon and vanilla. On the palate, gentle flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon and eucalyptus predominate over a bright burst of citrus. Tannins are a tad bold for a relatively delicate white wine, but they are tempered by baking spice flavors that wash across the tongue and notes of tangerine on the back palate."
"The Pfleck vineyard with its clay and limestone soil gives a rich style of Pinot Gris. This wine, with its intense spice and lychee flavors, is typical. It has a crisp edge but the ripe fruitiness and touch of pepper give weight and richness. Drink now."
"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex."
"Smooth-drinking, this offers soft, mellow flavors of melon and pear. Light but persistent, it's a clean, fresh and appealing selection, best enjoyed now."
"The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one."
"This lighter-bodied MencÃ­a from Valdeorras shows exotic, minerally aromas of raspberry, blueberry and Middle Eastern spices. The palate runs crisp and fresh, but not real deep or intense. Flavors of raspberry, plum and schist finish dry and floral, with a touch of lasting oak."
"Clean, peachy aromas set up a light, minerally, citrusy body. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and lemon hold steady and double up on gooseberry on the finish. Overall, this is round, minerally and elegant, but also slightly sour and edgy."
"There's a substantial earthiness to this Chardonnay, grown in a relatively cool estate vineyard. Vibrant on the palate in ripe apple and lemon, it offers medium weight and body, with a crispness to the finish and a food-friendly nature."
"Leathery cherry and cassis aromas are softened up by baking spice accents. In the mouth, this is hard-edged and pointed, with sharp, lemony acidity. Flavors of spiced plum and pie cherry finish with jagged acids and heat. This is a real enamel-peeler; more time in bottle can only help."
"This is a soft, slightly sweet rendering of Pinot Gris, loaded with succulent pear, pineapple and melon fruit. Chill it well and sip it by the pool this summer."
"Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County. The cider element carries to the rather pungent palate, proving quite high-toned and acidic with some minerality, grapefruit peel grip and long-lasting vibrancy on the finish."
"With its few years of aging, this is now a ripe and broad wine rich in yellow fruits that are cut with pear juice. It has nutty overtones, and a bright, crisp aftertaste."
"This juicy, delicious red features aromas of red berry, Mediterranean brush and aromatic herb. The easygoing palate doles out ripe blackberry, crushed Morello cherry, a charred note and a touch of baking spice alongside smooth, supple tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the succulent fruit."
"An attractive fragrance of white flower, stone fruit, apple and a whiff of smoke opens this linear wine. The bright palate offers dried citrus, Golden Delicious apple and mineral alongside brisk acidity."
"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment."
"This lacks a bit of midpalate richness, but otherwise offers fine drinking. Clove, cinnamon and leather complexities keep the cherry flavors interesting, while the finish is clean and crisp. Drink now."
"Varietally correct aromas of peach and melon form a good opening to this mostly fresh but fading AlbariÃ±o. Flavors of melon, papaya and peach are typical for the grape, and the finish is holding on but showing signs of maturation. Drink immediately."
"Dark in color and forcefully oaked on the nose, this resiny Malbec will appeal to fans of richly styled reds. Plum, berry, tomato leaf and herbal flavors finish woody but fair, with lasting acidity."
"In marked contrast to the plush, sexy 2010, the 2011 Patriarch is a stern taskmaster. The aromas and flavors of cherry, cedar and dried herbs are pleasant, but carry with them a worring dry astringency. Try drinking this over the near term, with rare beef to help ameliorate the tannin's effects."
"A pretty decent Rioja for the vintage, but you're going to have to be ready for some rubbery aromas and then staunch red fruit with a little bite. It's quite the traditional wine, with lemon peel, leather and tobacco. Runs short on the finish."
"The lightest in a range of GrÃ¼ner Veltliner from Hans Setzer. This is a green apple and grapefruit flavored wine, all lightness, freshness and crispness. There is a green plum skin tang to it, added to citrus."
"The wine boasts a pretty golden hue and segues to tones of almond skin, stone fruit, nut and cardboard. It feels smooth and rich in the mouth and has some tart citrus flavors on the close."
"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer."
"There's a saccharin or soda-like element to the nose of this Verduzzo-Friulano blend that gives the wine a cheerful, upfront personality but that overpowers the natural fruit. The wine tastes both tart and sweet and ends with butterscotch candy flavors."
"This is a pretty good buy for a Merlot that shows lots of polish and sophistication. It has savory black cherry, currant, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rugged and green, so it loses some points."
"Created by music industry businessman Kedar Massenburg (CEO Motown Records), the K'orus range is produced in the Languedoc. This Cabernet Sauvignon gives blackberry fruits, very juicy, lightly sweet to finish, but retaining attractive structure and acidity."
"Easy, creamy wine, with soft apple flavors and a touch of citrus. There is a light edge of toast to round out the soft, fleshy aftertaste."
"Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value."
"Quite leesy and funky, with meaty, oily aromas that are a departure from normal AlbariÃ±o and are indicative of the 30% Treixadura and Loureiro that beef things up. Perfectly drinkable, and with a decent mouthfeel, but still it lacks the straightforward cleanliness of the really good wines from Galicia. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co."
"Estancia produces solid, savory Pinot Grigios at a fair price, and they even dropped their price last year. This one's a little off-dry, with crisp acidity and pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors."
"With tobacco, molasses, spearmint and baked fruit aromas, this finds itself squarely in the old school forum. The palate shows straight-ahead red fruit with light herbal and pepper accents. Snappy and a bit thin, but it offers all the basics."
"Grassy and tonic with background shadings of white flower and stone fruit, this Ribolla Gialla offers aromas of white peach, kiwi and subtle hints of exotic fruit. The wine is crisp and lean in the mouth."
"Beyond the spice of this cool-climate wine,  the flavors offer red berry fruits, fresh acidity and stalky tannins. It's soft, easy to drink now."
"One of the original in the new generation of light, fresh GrÃ¼ner Veltliner, Veltlinsky is a good example. With its green apple directness and smooth structure, it is a wine for the year, a fine apÃ©ritif or seafood partner. Screwcap."
"A little tart and pickled off the bat, with notes of rhubarb and red cherry along with a stronger, more evident blast of oak. The palate is fresh but sort of lean and wanting, with regular raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy but slightly sappy and resiny for what's on offer."
"This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants."
"La Piazza is a line of wine from Sicily's Calatrasi winery that uses fruit from various parts of Italy. This is their Pinot Grigio from northern Italy that tastes rich and creamy and is made in a New World style. Aromas revolve around butter, almond paste, peach and apricot. It doesn't have huge length, but it does taste rich and dense."
"As in nearby Sauternes, 2005 produced some exceptionally rich botrytised wine in Monbazillac. This example from one of the leading Bergerac producers certainly shows plenty of richness, but it seems rather too sugary, showing toffee flavors and fatness. The acidity is missing."
"For those with a classical bent, Clos Teddi is named after Thetis, sea goddess and mother of Achilles. This rosÃ©, appropriately, summons up lunch by the ocean, with its crisp, fresh, dry strawberry and pink grapefruit flavors, just touched by caramel."
"Young spring flowers, lemongrass, green melon and dandelion come to mind and color what is a fresh wine with an easy, no-fuss approach. There's no big complicated story here, but that's exactly the point."
"Layered and rustic, this wine starts with aromas of tobacco and sausage and leads into spicy, dark fruit flavors. Vibrant with supple tannins, the wine needs some time."
"This is a ripe, slightly jammy blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot with tones of cooked spice and blackberry pie. There are also some green leafy notes in the back backed by dense black tea that come as a surprise. You'll feel some grit on the palate and more fruit flavors on the close."
"Ripe and fruity, this is already delicious, but that doesn't detract from the firm tannins and density of a wine that will age well. It has all the elements, with the fruit, solid tannins and a juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2025."
"Composed, complex and complete, this mellow wine is very comfortable in its skin. Touches of oak, tobacco, dried plum and cardamom fill the aroma, and ripe but not overripe black cherry, tamarind and cola flavors flood the palate, supported by fine-grained tannins and medium-full body."
"This wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola. Approachable and delicious, it hits the mark on every level being light bodied and refreshingly balanced while complex."
"With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit. Streaks of espresso, vanilla and chocolate come through, suggesting it will only improve with a hearty decant or additional bottle age. Drink now through the mid-2020s."
"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine. Its black fruit is ribbed wtih iron, licorice, coffee and graphite notes and framed by earthy tannins that lend texture. It drinks bigger than its listed alcohol would suggest."
"This single vineyard wine is a blend of six separate blocks, each planted to a different clone. It deftly combines savory herb flavors with ripe Bing cherry fruit. The tannins are polished, textured and balanced, leading into a long finish that leaves a final impression of composted earth."
"This wine's enticing rose, blue flower, menthol and herb scents come together in the glass. On the taut, precise palate, tightly knit, refined tannins enwrap crunchy red cherry and juicy cranberry flavors. White pepper and clove notes add depth, while bright acidity lends balance. Drink 2023â€“2035."
"This is a major Douro wine from the PoÃ§as family-owned Port and wine producer. Dusty tannins already give it class as well as richness. Packed with black-plum fruits and with good concentration, the wine is still maturing. It needs to age further, so drink from 2019."
"Full of ripe fruit, this wine is rich while also having a delicately perfumed character. With its spice, generous fruits and sense of poise, it will age well. Drink from 2027."
"Sourced from vines planted in 1847, this is a full-bodied, open-knit wine, supple and velvety in texture. Vanilla cream and black cherries mark the nose, while the flavors are more savory, resembling black olives and grilled meat. It's long and lush on the finish. Drink it now through 2025."
"Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass. A strong floral component of jasmine invites on the nose, while sparkling acidity maintains a freshness amidst the integrated oak and delicious flavors of honeyed pear and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e."
"From old vines planted in a single vineyard, this is a spectacular red. It has the crisp acidity of the cool-climate Sancerre, but it also has the weight and ripeness of a fine Burgundy. The wood aging has left a spicy toasty edge to the beautiful cherry fruits and acidity. It could age for another year to be at its best. Drink from 2019."
"This savory, firmly structured, full-bodied red opens with subtle dark berry, rose petal, pipe tobacco and crushed herb aromas. It delivers layers of juicy Marasca cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon and clove flavors, buttressed by youthfully assertive but refined tannins and nicely balanced, with fresh acidity. Drink 2023â€“2033."
"Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathesâ€”and seems to disappear way too quickly once opened."
"This winery is earning a place among Oregon's best with its top tier wines, like this one. Complex and loaded with bee pollen, crisp apple, lime zest, seabreeze and toasted cracker notes, it leaves you breathless the longer it breathes."
"As characterful as the dry version but with lower alcohol and a slight hint of sweetness, this boasts powerful tangerine, quince and Meyer lemon fruit. Its electric acidity keeps it vivid and beautifully balanced. Delicious now, it's also cellar-worthy."
"More tart than sweet, this delicious wine is packed with lemon drop, candied pineapple and tangerine fruit. The acidity is in perfect proportion with the slightly sweet palate, giving it a vivid mouthfeel that extends into the finish and offers versatility for food pairing."
"Lighter in color, this wine is aromatic and expressive, with notes of fire pit, blood, black olive tapenade, sea salt, black pepper, cured meat, nori, crushed flowers and umami. The palate brings soft, lithe, focused notes of earth and savory flavors that shimmer on the salty finish. It's all about delicacy but the aroma and flavor expression is compelling. Give it some time in the cellar or decant."
"Estate-grown, this 100% varietal wine impresses in its total embrace of succulent blackberry, plum and mocha goodness, built upon a mountain of structured tannin and quiet oak. Touches of milk chocolate play along the palate as it rides along a velvety roadway, finishing soft and silky."
"The Meridian in the name is the zero-longitude Prime Meridian which passes through this vineyard. The wine, with its minty flavors from new-wood aging, is serious, concentrated and with an impressive structure. The dark firm character of this wine promises plenty more aging. Drink from 2020."
"From dry-farmed 40-year-old vines perched along the Rutherford Bench, this impressive offering is sanguine and elegantly balanced, a showcase of cranberry, raspberry and milk chocolate. Refined acidity contributes to an overall lightness, with dried herb and dust lingering on the finish."
"All Trisaetum's dry Rieslings feel a notch riper in this warm year, to good effect. Meticulous blending of individual lots, some aged in oak, brings layers of complexity and helps differentiate each cuvÃ©e. Concentrated pear, peach and papaya flavors are on display here, with tangy acidity and superb length and richness. It's dry, to be sure, but also brilliantly fruity."
"Smoky, with bursts of sage and celery root, this is a wine that is unabashedly earthy, spicy, bold and juicy at its core. Light-bodied and delicate, the palate shows beautiful floral undertones. This is a complex and beguiling bottling that should hold well for years to come."
"The aromas of this wine leap from the glass, with notes of orange peel, potpourri, smoked meat, spice, fresh herb, stem, ash and plum. It's expressive, but still wound up. The flavors are focused, concentrated and savory, bringing a sense of intensity and richness but also lightness. The balance is exquisite."
"This is an impressively well-crafted, and beautiful wine, blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, the main variety mountain-grown on Pritchard Hill. It shines in big, bold and powerfully built black fruit and leather. Dusty, firm tannins and a taste of graphite, coffee and tar are also highly evident. The finish is tart and seasoned in white pepper. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033."
"Ripe, fruity and balanced, this has the potential to be a delicious, not-too-concentrated wine. Acidity and some dry tannins give the wine a firm character that is balanced by the fragrant berry fruits. Drink from 2026."
"From a three-acre spot known to get a hearty dose of fog, this wine speaks to cool-climate character, unveiling crisp floral layers of dried sage and white pepper from the get-go. Those aspects are joined by rose, lavender and cranberry-rhubarb on the palate, finishing with subtle offerings of mushroom and forest floor."
"From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular."
"Old-vine Pinot Noir has produced a rich structured wood-aged wine. With its opulent texture and ripe full-bodied cherries and red plums, the wine is poised and generous. Drink this impressive wine from 2018."
"This reserve-level wine from the Roserock vineyard, Domaine Drouhin's recent Eola-Amity Hills planting, is compelling. Dense and fragrant, it boasts a beguiling mix of rose, cocoa powder and Asian spice, like a magic carpet ride of flavor. A finishing note of chocolate-covered orange peel is the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance."
"The winery shows its prowess with making delicious, affordable larger-production wines with this bright and easy drinking Cabernet, a study in soft tannins, juicy cranberry/currant fruit and composed structure. It's a good one to stock up on at the price and quality."
"Earthy red-fruit aromas come with hints of olive, herbs and spice. The mouthfeel on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and CarmenÃ¨re is racy and layered. Flavors of herbal berry and spice finish long. Drink through 2018."
"This super-smooth late harvest effort is perfectly balanced among sugar/alcohol/acid components. Lively and rich, it offers concentrated flavors of limoncello, apricot and candied peaches. Drink it chilled for best effect."
"Creamy and well-integrated, this offers personality and style. The crisp bite of green apple and lemon curd are textured and long-lasting. With its overall balance, it is a fantastically versatile pairing option."
"With the scent of watermelon chapstick leading the way, this is a fruit-forward wine you want to kiss. Other aromas on the sweet-and-spicy nose include stewed plums and a dill-led herbal element. The flavors of red fruits and brown spice make for a completely delicious experience."
"Despite showing gritty, scratchy aromas of baked, earthy black fruits, this Carignan-led blend is rock solid and ready. Tight, punchy, focused acidity sets up a rustic palate with a mix of baked-fruit flavors, spice and char. A toasty, dark, long finish is staunch and sturdy. Drink through 2016."
"Wild thyme and moss blaze a savory trail before honeyed sweetness, cut by wonderfully precise, lemon-sharp acidity. This is linear and superclean, and that wonderful sweet-acid contrast should make this BA a winner both with the dessert trolley and the cheeseboard."
"There's a ying-yang of rich crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout."
"With alcohol in the low-moderate range, this immaculately fresh wine is flush with juicy gooseberry and grapefruit. It carries the varietal hallmarks of fresh herbs, notably chive, and a balancing lick of minerality."
"This is as perfumed an example of Syrah as you'll find from the Southern RhÃ´ne. Hints of herbs, spice and violets accent blueberry fruit in this charming wine. It's medium in bodyâ€”not that rich but or layered but supple, silky and easily accessible. Drink this through the end of 2015."
"Intense aromas of blue flower, red berry and licorice lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. Menthol, licorice, cake spices and a blast of orange zest complement the juicy, red cherry and black raspberry flavors."
"Boushey and Red Willow are the vineyards that contribute to this 100% varietal Cabernet Franc. There's excellent concentration to the brambly, bright, blackberry fruit, and some sharp acidity to underscore it. It's pure varietal and should continue to improve 2019â€“2021."
"Fresh, gushing fruit flavors such as raspberry, red cherry and boysenberry fill out this expressive and well-balanced wine. It is sweetly fruity in aroma, full-flavored, full-bodied, firm and dry in texture but not heavy. It craves ribs or wood-fired pizza."
"Distinct crushed lava rock aromas meet with dust, cinnamon, cola and Dr Pepper on this blend of 28% Syrah, 22% Grenache, 17% Cinsault, 17% MourvÃ¨dre and 16% Carignane. Light red fruits of cranberry and slight strawberry show on the palate that dives into serious tannins quickly."
"Black currant, bell pepper and leather aromas lead the way on this blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. The dense palate delivers ripe black cherry, grilled pepper, mocha and cracked black pepper alongside bracing tannins."
"With a black color and deep, resiny aromas of licorice, baking spices and black fruits, this is a big, Tempranillo with plenty of size and tannic bite. Flavors of earthy, oaky, loamy plum and blackberry finish with licorice, spice and baked notes. Drink through 2018."
"The nose falls somewhere between smoky and gritty, while dusty white-fruit scents prop things up. Peachy acidity and citric tang let you know this is a â€œnatureâ€ Cava, while nectarine, rhubarb and green-herb flavors finish razor crisp and dry."
"Dense almost to the point of chewiness, this is a concentrated blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache. Earthy, plummy notes pick up hints of dark chocolate and licorice before ending rich and velvety."
"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively."
"Opening with aromas of underbrush, perfumed berries and crushed violets, this balanced Rosso displays its pedigree. The savory palate delivers dense wild cherry layered with orange peel, white pepper, mocha and cake spices alongside supple tannins. Energizing minerality signals the close. Enjoy nowâ€“2017."
"This 2008 holdover shows a mix of jammy, composed berry aromas as well as staunch notes of dried cheese and leather. The palate is firm at first, then more loamy and layered. On the flavor profile, baked berry blends with brine and cardamom, while on the finish this ready-to-drink RDD delivers licorice and earthy baked notes."
"One of a string of great values made at Terravant near Santa Barbara. Attractively oaky, it's full-bodied, full-flavored and just tannic enough to make it a good pairing for rich meat or cheese courses. It is deep in color, with a slightly tawny rim. It smells like wood smoke and grilled bread, tastes deep as blackberry and delivers cherry flavors that linger on the finish."
"Rich cherry and spicy black pepper introduce the nose to this wine from the Adelaida district. The flavors explore the more nuanced, not overly jammy side of the grape, with tart acidity and a good tannic backbone ensuring a long life. Decent now, but better to drink 2018â€“2022."
"Ripe black plum, forest floor, mint and spice notes lead the nose on this savory, medium-bodied red. The succulent, straightforward palate doles out fleshy black cherry and crushed raspberry accented with black pepper and clove alongside round tannins. Drink through 2015."
"A blend of white Bordeaux and local Gers grapes, this is a smooth, medium sweet wine. With three years of aging, it has become mature, rich in smoky flavors as well as dried apricot and bitter oranges. Acidity keeps everything in line. It's ready to drink."
"Chardonay and Pinot Noir are both present in this apple and pear flavored wine. A lively mousse brings out the fruit and acidity, giving a tangy, bright wine that's ready to drink now."
"This wine came out of the disaster of shriveled Duras grapes after an especially hot period. Rather than discarding them, Domaine Rotier made a wine. Wood aged, it has many of the characters of a late harvest with its rich, sweet, lightly tannic flavors and sufficient acidity to balance. A surprising success."
"While ebulliently peachy and floral on the nose, savory notes of dried reeds and savory herbs overwhelm the fruit flavors in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. It's crisp and refreshingly composed, but finishes a bit short. Drink now."
"Red apple, spice and honey aromas lead to medium-sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the concentration doesn't seem all there."
"This wine is an unusual blend of Touriga (38%), Tinto CÃ£o (20%), Tempranillo (18%), Petit Verdot (15%) and SouzÃ£o. Alcohol aromas show prominently along with dark fruit. The fruit flavors seem dried out, juxtaposed by the sweetness of the wine, with the tannins having a real sense of grip."
"This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea."
"Based in the heart of the Haut-MÃ©doc, this property has produced a wine that shows a dry character, with bitter extraction and too much wood. There are just hints of juicy fruit that will need time to come through. It could well stay dry and firm always."
The producer has probably used too much wood for the fruit and density of this wine. The toastiness does not allow any fruit to show through.
"This wine is lean with acidity playing over the red-currant fruits, leaving a character that's light and tight. While the wine will soften it's not likely to show any more weight or richness."
"Prickly aromas of juniper and cherry are sharp and lean towards green. This Malbec feels tight and lean, while plum and herbal aromas qualify as basic. A light, racy finish pinches and tastes generic."
"This is a challenging mix of substantially puckering tannins and herbaceous notes, dotted in black peppercorns. The fruit is elusive."
"Despite some ripe, honeyed aromas, this is light in body and quite lean on the palate. Underripe pineapple flavors show a tart, herbal edge on the finish."
"This soft, jammy and fruity wine is ready to drink, with black-currant flavors that are ripe and rounded. Only the lightest tannins gives any structure to this wine that is immediately accessible."
Too enthusiastic use of wood has left this wine bereft of fruit and unbalanced.
"This wine is structured and stalky without the fruit weight, reflecting the difficult vintage. A smoky character comes through the acidity to leave a dry aftertaste. Through 2016, it will soften a little, although always missing the fruit. The blend is 55% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Ssauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc."
"Prickly aromas of nettle are simple as well as diluted. This feels basic and fresh, while green, citrusy flavors end with pithy notes and an oily feel."
"This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot. Relatively light bodied, it has a muted nose. The flavors lean towards overripe, more dried fruit than fresh."
"This easygoing, simple red offers hints of dark berry flavors while a note of dark spice fleetingly appears in the background. It's uber-informal and rather diluted with a short but clean finish."
"This informal rosato offers delicate aromas and flavors of wild red berry and blood orange. It's rather lean and diluted, with bracing acidity."
An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine. It's made to be medium bodied and enjoyable now.
"Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay. It's a rather fat, cream-textured wine but sunny tangerine acidity and fresher notes of apple and pear flavors do get a peek through the midpalate."
"Aromas of corn and melon are waxy and oily. This feels pinched and juicy, but not crisp or minerally. Stalky flavors of corn, citrus and apple lean towards bitter, as does the finish."
"Aromas like green apples and lemons, and herbal flavors make this wine refreshing and balanced toward the lean side. It's rather light bodied and crisp in texture."
"After 34 months in previously used French barrels, this wine has a brownish rim. It smells like pepper, clove and cinnamon and tastes like dried fruit. Considerable tannins contribute to an astringent mouthfeel."
"This Meritage is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Tasting quite ripe, it has a burnt sage and cedar undertone. Tannins hit on the back of the palate with power and not much finesse."
"This fresh wine has plenty of acidity as well as some firm tannins. It is still young, waiting to fill out with riper fruit flavors. The aftertaste just repeats the acidity."
"With the pale color of onion skin, this rosÃ© has muted aromas of damp earth and dried rose petal. The lean, diluted palate reveals suggestions of red berry alongside brisk acidity."
"The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together."
"This lean red initially opens with a sulfur aroma that burns off to reveal steeped prune, dried violet and a hint of resin. The diluted, fleeting palate offers hints of black cherry and walnut skin."
"Lean and tannic, this wine has chocolate and bitter coffee flavors from over-extraction. The fruit is suppressed at this stage, with a bitter aftertaste."
"Blocky, stewy, raisiny aromas of nonspecific black fruits are jumbled and green. This feels awkward and jammy, with little to no structural integrity. Flavors of prune, raisin and oak finish soft and loamy."
"Coffee grinds and caramel mingle with hints of popcorn and dried herbs in this curious blend of white grapes which have been aged Sherry-style in a solera. Whiffs of dried fruit and caramel are enticing, but the palate juxtaposes craggy acidity with mouthfeel that's dampening and flat."
"This is spicy and sharp, with high-toned fruit flavors of berry and currant. Acids are strong and provide good focus, with a spicy/peppery note resonating through the finish."
"The focus of this full, rounded, soft Pinot Blanc is on the pear flavors. The mineral texture is about easy-drinking freshness allied to attractive acidity."
"This wine boasts admirable complexity, but comes across as a bit angular, with the acids maybe a touch too prominent. Still, the flavors of mint, pepper and meat layered over plum and raspberry fruit offer a lot to like, and the acids may actually make this wine more versatile with food than many more unctuous Shiraz."
"The White Fox is a refreshing, crisp white that offers a balance of acidity, spice and creamy pear flavors. There's body and the wine has weight without being heavy, its lemon acidity keeping it aloft."
"Manfred Felsner obviously enjoys the spicy character of GrÃ¼ner Veltliner, because, like all his wines from this varietal, this has spice in spades. But it also has good fresh acidity, which emphasizes the green fruit character of the wine, bringing out the crispness of the year. Screwcap."
"Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle. It's quite rich in chocolate, black currant and spice flavors wrapped into smooth, thick tannins, with a burn of alcohol on the finish."
"A big, ripe wine, full of berry fruits and rhubarb, edged with tannins, spice and red plum skins. It has a juicy, rich quality, enhanced by acidity, and rounded with vanilla. Keep for a year. Screwcap."
"This highly aromatic, softly sweet wine brings together lychees, mango and pear-skin flavors, given freshness from acidity. Light, poised, delicate, it leaves a delicious lift."
"The bone-dry, earthy minerality of Assyrtiko blends well with the crisp, fresh fruit flavors of Sauvignon Blanc in this white blend. Clean, simple flavors of citrus, spice and slate give the wine a quaffable, food-friendly edge."
"There's a distinctly mineral, almost ashen quality to this wine that recalls talcum powder and schoolroom chalkboard. The wine is linear and defined and has very pungent, almost sharp, effervescence with drying minerals on the close and will keep the palate polished and clean."
"This Prosecco Extra Dry has a subtle, easy approach with measured fruit intensity but recognizable sweetness in the form of silky honey and melon. It offers a good measure of cleaning effervescence and chewy fruit to keep it going."
"Delicate and sweet, this pretty Prosecco offers delicate floral notes and shadings of banana and exotic fruit. It is light and foamy in the mouth with full, soft texture and sensual sweetness on the close."
"Simple peach aromas characterize this Prosecco Dry with a creamy, frothy cap, pretty bubbling and measured aromas of fruit salad and kiwi. The wine comes alive in the mouth thanks to its pretty mineral tones and generous fruity sweetness: Made from late-harvest Prosecco grapes."
"From Gallo, a two-county blend with some real elegance and style. The Cab is dry, soft and full-bodied, with lingering blackberry, currant, licorice and spice flavors. Drink now."
"With its peppery spices and briary, brambly notes of ripe wild berries, this wine tastes more like Zinfandel than Merlot. It's not true to the variety, but it is a solid red wine, dry and full-bodied."
"Here is a very clean and pristine Prosecco Brut with measured but distinct notes of white peach, acacia flower and chopped kiwi. The wine tastes creamy and slightly sweet with chewy peach flavors. It makes a perfect aperitif wine."
"In keeping with the winery's other red wine releases, the Cedarosa matches tart berry fruits to lush barrel flavors of butter and toast. It's approachable and somewhat monolithic."
"Tonic and lean, this foamy sparkler delivers aromas of stone fruit, honey and yellow flower. It's a delicate, feminine wine with characteristic almond-like sourness on the close."
"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. â€œPulpyâ€ is another descriptor."
"Despite weighing in at 12% alcohol, this seems light in body and sweet in style, with honeyed pineapple aromas and flavors of apple skin and lime. Finishes stridently, with a dusty texture."
"A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now."
"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling. This '05 is a little too ripe, soft and heavy, but the chocolate-inspired red currant, cola and licorice flavors are lip-smackingly good."
"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it. The color is dark and the palate is round; flavors of black plum, figs and black olives convey a meaty, true personality amid all the char, chocolate and vanilla. A good wine in the massive category that is value-priced Merlot."
"Fresh, crisp, citrus and floral flavors make a light, easy GrÃ¼ner Veltliner, a great summer drink of light white fruits and green berries. Screwcap."
This is textbook Prosecco Extra Dry with sweet fragrances of stone fruit and white flower backed by mineral shadings and delicious honey. The wine is simple with lively acidity on the close.
"Made from old vines, this rich rosÃ© is full of fruit. It has fine acidity as well as wild-strawberry flavors. The texture, lightly mineral, gives the wine a crisp, tight shape. With a fresh aftertaste, the wine will be just right for food."
"Aromas of blackberry and briar patch expand to include violet notes. In the mouth, there's pulpy weight to the fruit and rubbery tannins for framing. Rugged but generic black-fruit flavors finish with toasty darkness and some burn."
"Packed with red fruits and crisp acidity, this lively wine has a tight mousse, while the red-currant fruitiness adds intense acidity. The wine is bright and ready to drink."
"Honeylike aromas, ripe peach and apple flavors and rather full body give this wine good depth and breadth. It seems like just the thing for a picnic or to serve with cheese at a party."
"Aromas suggesting dried rose petal, woodland berry, chopped mint and kitchen spice come together on this. The tight palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose, offering sour cherry, tart cranberry and a hint of clove alongside bracing tannins that grip the finish."
"Beyond a hint of stuck flint on the nose, this offers clean, varietally correct aromas and flavors of white nectarine, grapefruit and gooseberry. It's nicely balanced in the middle of the spectrum, offering a harmonious mix of stone fruit and citrus."
"Underbrush, singed earth, mature dark-skinned fruit and a balsamic note emerge in the glass. The ripe, firm palate shows mocha, black raspberry and licorice as well as a slightly green note of raw sage. A backbone of bracing tannins provides the tight framework."
"This opens with aromas of oak, toast and espresso that carry over to the firmly structured palate along with herb and dried black cherry. Austere tannins clench the finish."
"A rich full wine that has swathes of black fruits. It has a dry core around which there are generous fruits and the right amount of acidity. Perfumed, ripe and concentrated, this is ready to drink now."
"This tangy wine has attractive acidity and a tightly coiled mineral texture. Apple and lemon flavors shoot right through the bright, crisp texture. Drink from 2017."
"From a winery that specializes in this rare variety, this single varietal Papaskarasi has a nose of cherry, strawberry and freesia. It is bright on entry, and then smooth tannins and a sense of coolness take over the palate among flavors of cherry, menthol, cranberry and juniper berry."
"From vines in the northern part of the appellation, this ripe wine conveys peaches and apricots laced with lime. A vibrant, mineral wine with swathes of fresh acidity, it can be drunk now."
"This rich wine is full and has a good balance of acidity and fruit. The lightly mineral texture gives bite and crispness. It is still a young, tight wine needing another few months. Drink from 2017."
"Crisp green-apple freshness blends with hints of butter and vanilla for a nicely balanced, un-oaky, medium-bodied wine at a very reasonable price."
"Spicy, fruity and attractive, this balanced wine has acidity, tight minerality, yellow fruits and a richer texture. Full bodied and generous, it will age well. Drink from 2017."
"Made to be drunk young, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has a juicy blackberry flavor, plenty of acidity and a soft, smooth aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
"Olive, saucy berry and a sense of rawness on the nose drive this Malbec towards a solid but slightly scratchy feeling palate. Plum, blackberry and minty oak flavors are short and lightly herbal, while this ends without much force."
"Rubbery, gaseous initial aromas give way to piquant red-fruit notes. This feels lean, racy and very high in acidity. Limited flavors of currant, tomato and salty red plum finish with herbal notes and persistent saltiness as well as abrasive acidity."
"Leathery aromas of horseradish and stewed berries lead to a rooty, syrupy palate. Flavors of cola, chocolate and raisin are creamy as a whole. This tastes ripe on the finish, with raisin and oxidized notes. This Merlot-Cabernet-Malbec blend has its strong points but comes across baked and raisiny."
"Though aged in neutral oak, this wine opens with scents and flavor hints of toast and butter. The fruit is clean and generic, like a fresh apple, but the mouthfeel lacks life and fades into a flat finish. Drink up."
"This opens with aromas of menthol, coconut, oak, overripe black cherry, leather and exotic spice. The bracing palate shows dried black cherry, clove, ground pepper and a green note of powdered sage alongside assertive grainy tannins."
"At less than 13% abv, this is on the lighter side of the RhÃ´ne white spectrum, offering simple pear and toasted marshmallow aromas and flavors that finish lean and crisp."
"This is plump and custardy in feel, but still refreshing thanks to bright apple and lime aromas and flavors. It's more citrus than apple on the crisp finish."
"Whiffs of sugar cookies and raspberries entice on this consistently pleasing bargain buy. Fruity and floral and a just shade off dry, its an easygoing wine but with a depth beyond what one might presume from its cheeky packaging. Finishes on a lingering white peach note."
"Fresh, crisp and fruity, this is an immediately drinkable wine. It has great freshness, lively acidity and perfumed apple fruitiness. The acidity cuts through brightly and leaves a vibrant, textured aftertaste."
"There's a solid concentration of red and black berries to the nose of this wine, with tar and soy sauce giving depth. Solid tannic grip on the palate offers support to the array of dark cherry and blackberry alongside sandalwood and smoke."
"This wine is very good in a ripe, almost-sweet style. It smells and tastes like blackberry pie, has full fruit flavors and a smooth, rich texture without noticeable tannins."
"Syrah, CastelÃ£o and Aragonez go into the blend of this rich juicy wine. It is so soft and ripe, just hinting at tannins and with red-berry fruit. The wine is round and smooth, ready to drink."
"This offers aromas suggesting cherries marinated in spirits, underbrush and a whiff of camphor while the firm but rather lean palate offers grilled herb, licorice and a note of sour cherry. Astringent tannins grip the finish."
"There's a touch (17%) of new oak here, which adds flavors of caramel and vanilla to the rather tart and simple fruit. It falls into the generic yellow/green apple style, with hints of arugula."
"Truffle, underbrush, new leather and chopped herb aromas slowly emerge in the glass. The bright, elegantly structured palate delivers tart cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside vibrant acidity and tightly wound noble tannins. It's still youthfully austere so give it time to develop. Drink 2023â€“2033."
"Old vines, many up to 80-years-old, supply the grapes that were fermented in traditional granite lagars for a ripe jammy character in this powerful wine. It has solid tannins and great acidity, both of which will allow the wine to age. Drink this impressive wine from 2020."
"This is an assertive, flavorful and robust wine, with a medium to full body, a mouthfilling texture and fine-beaded bubbles. A creamy viscosity and wonderful layers of butter, apple, vanilla and ginger make for a delicious palate."
"Black in color, this heavy concentrated wine is thick in black pepper and clove, with underlying streaks of cedar. Well structured, it unfurls depths of black cherry, currant and vanilla as it develops in the glass, finishing a full bodied as it started."
"This blend works in commingling 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, all from the producer's vineyard. Caramel sparks a richness against which herbal, woody tannins speak. The body expansive and full, and the finish awash in spicy clove."
"Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality. More bay leaf and pine needle show on the herbally full and texturally grippy palate, giving minty spice to the dark fruit flavors."
"Dark and deep aromas of black cherry, clove, allspice, black pepper and char make for a hearty impression on this appellation blend. The palate is also rich and powerful, its thick mouthfeel showing black cherry, cocoa, vanilla and a touch of asphalt. A rocky minerality and minty finish complete the experience."
"Complex and composed, this vineyard-designate wine is brightly decorated in flavors of grapefruit pith and lemon zest, with zippy acidity. As it develops in the glass, richer elements of peach and apricot flesh out the palate with succulent aplomb."
"This estate whose name means four winds is in the Douro Superior, the easternmost part of the Douro region. It is intensely rich and solidâ€”a classic blend for the region with a dominance of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, aged in wood and with plenty more aging ability. This black-fruit-flavored wine will be best from 2020."
"From the Barton family's estate vineyard, this is a very dark Syrah with aromas of blackberry, balsamic, lavender and thyme flowers. There's a rich blueberry flavor at the core of the palate, where cocoa shavings, tense tannins and a lilac florals combine for a multi-layered wine."
"Alluring aromas of dark-skinned berry, exotic spice and an earthy note of tilled soil come together in the glass. The elegant, structured palate delivers red currant, Marasca cherry and star anise alongside bright acidity and refined tannins. It's well balanced and delicious. Drink through 2022."
"Alluring aromas of beeswax, white spring flower and acacia float from the glass. On the vibrant palate, crisp acidity offsets yellow apple, Anjou pear and nectarine while the slightest hint of paraffin graces the dry finish."
"Scott Sampler's experimentation with extra long macerations seem to imbue even more of a sense of place to his wines. In this case, that translates to very purple aromas of grape Jolly Ranchers, violet oil and warm black licorice. An exotic Indian-candy spice shows on the tip of the sip, leading into rich blueberry and fresh purple-flower flavors, with coffee and cocoa on the finish."
"This smooth, rich and fine wine is maturing well. It has a good balance of ripe fruit and acidity. Bitter coffee and spice notes add complexity while not detracting from the fruit. Drink from 2020."
"Lilacs and wisteria combine for a floral and approachable nose in this clonal study, which is also loaded with clove, peppercorn, rosemary and elderberry aromas. It's soft and lush on the palate, with rich plum and black cherry flavors leveled by notes of anise, potpourri, fresh mint and Earl Grey tea."
"Extremely lively peppercorn aromas meet with black plum, blackberry, dried violets and lavender on the nose of this bottling by vineyard manager Ruben Solorzano. The palate is spicy with cracked pepper, rosemary oil and pine needles, which mix with the blackberry and elderberry fruits. Roasted lamb flavors also make an appearance against tannins that rise up in the finish."
"After three years en tirage, this well-evolved wine is heady and floral, made to highlight and celebrate diversity. Creamy and lush on the palate, it has a rounded richness of stone fruit. Made predominantly from Pinot Noir, it has an accentuated taste of strawberry shortcake."
"The Reserva version of the popular Borba brand in Portugal is a dense, powerfully tannic wine. Its juicy black currant and blackberry fruits are suffused with tanninsâ€”its dry core surrounded by richness. Hints of dark chocolate and pepper come from the alcohol but certainly don't take away from the great fruitiness of the wine. Drink from 2019."
"What a treat to find a great rendition of this rare varietal. Concentrated black-fruit flavors pair beautifully with aromatic oak accents in this bold and complex wine. It has plenty of tannins to support the intense blackberry and blueberry flavors, while enticing cinnamon, cumin and leather come up in the aroma and last through the lingering finish."
"Dark gold in color, a strong note of apple skin gives way to tight acidity on the entry of this wine. As it develops in the glass, it becomes plush and fleshy, imparting complex elements of candied quince and orange blossom."
"Marc Piro continued to hone his craft under Jim Clendenen at Au Bon Climat, and that expertise shows in this bottling, which combines Presqu'ile and Bien Nacido Vineyards to produce a wine that's both zesty in the underripe style yet full of fruit as well. Aromas of wild oregano, thyme, tapenade and red cherry lead into a palate full of tantalizing acidity, with tart Montmorency cherry, tangy tomato and fennel spice."
"This elegant bottling by two service-industry veterans shows tons of potpourri, dried lavender, black raspberry and red plum on the nose. The flavors are quite broad and inviting, with hibiscus and ripe tomato meshing into juniper and clove. It's light in mouthfeel and weight, but well structured."
"This producer specializes in seeking out parcels of old vines. In this case, the vines, planted at high density, have unusually crooked trunks. The wine itself, richly tannic and dense, has new wood flavors, ripe black-plum fruits and a dark firm character. It is still young and will develop into an impressively rich wine. Drink from 2019."
"Elegant and beautiful aromas of Montmorency cherry, tart orange peel and balsamic fig reduction sauce prove precise and show some mature vine age. Roasted fig flavors meet with salt and pepper seasonings on the palate, which is well structure and full of bright acidity."
"Extreme concentration combined with a velvety texture make this inky-dark wine made from Tannat and Dornfelder compelling to taste. The color is black with a thin ruby rim while black cherry, cedar and tobacco fill the aroma and crÃ¨me de cassis meets espresso on the palate. The mouthfeel is polished as very fine-grained tannins blend with a rich viscosity."
"From the Carneros-based producer with its roots in Spain, this succeeds in its velvety smooth texture, juicy fruit and supportive acidity. Black licorice and spiced plum are given additional richness by a jolt of dark chocolate."
"With a fruity exuberance of crisp cranberry and red cherry, this wine delights in touches of nuanced herb and earth. Light bodied and refreshing, it maintains elegant complexity and depth, a lovely example of site and winemaking."
"Earthy aromas of turned soil meet with dark red currant and a layer of smoke on the nose of this estate bottling by the historic vineyard. Strawberry, smoked pork and a touch of lavender show on the sip, which rides a strong acidity that arises in the midpalate and persists deep into the finish."
"Very roasted notes of coffee, warm leather, tobacco leaves, sagebrush and stewed blackberries show on the nose of this blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Grenache and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The roasted quality carries through the sip, with more coffee and char tones alongside dried plums, crushed gravel and dusty tannins."
"This new project focusing on specific blocks of the historic Cambria Vineyard on the Santa Maria Bench starts with very subtle and restrained aromas of nectarine, lemon cream and a hint of grapefruit pith. The palate is fresh with lime and toasted coconut flavors, held up by a backbone of strong acid that keeps it from spilling toward overripe qualities."
"Pretty concentration and deep saturation set the stage for penetrating aromas of blackberry, exotic spice and chopped green herbs. This is a rich Sangiovese (with 10% Canaiolo) with bright freshness and lingering spice on the finish."
"A wine that aims to bring out the casual side of Bordeaux, this is friendly, accessible, without losing the essential dry tannins and fresh black currant flavors typical of the region. If only all branded Bordeaux was like this."
"There's an interesting note of honey or maple syrup that gives this Riserva a uniquely smooth and supple style. Fruit aromas recall dried prunes, fig and currants. The wine offers elegant, fine texture in the mouth."
"Yes, it has 2003 ripeness, but there is also some restraint here. The tannins are still defiantly young, the fruit packed with black plum jelly flavors. It promises 2â€“3 years' aging."
"Here is a solid, widely distributed, well-priced, all-purpose Chardonnay. It's got plenty of buttery toast, soft and round fruitâ€”lightly peachyâ€”and unusual richness for a wine in this price range. It's a California style with a Washington twistâ€”real acid."
"This wine has a delicate nose of citrus and spicy nuts, with robust, round flavors of apple, citrus and spice. Balanced acid and fruit means the wine has complexity, but is still refreshing. Mouthwatering and food friendly, the Chardonnay has added class."
"This medium-bodied dry white is prettily aromatic, showing hints of orange blossom, pineapple and pear upfront, then building on the base of fruit with hints of wet stones and a dry, almost chalky finish."
"Tasted at the age of 38 months, Erba's Bordeaux blend is a dense, tannicly dry wine. It has well-ripened flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and cedar. If you drink it now, decant. Best before 2011, before the fruit falls out."
"This delicate, elegant NLH wine starts with alluring aromas of lush honey, apricot and citrus and offers a vibrant, lively balance of fruit and acid. Pair with cheeses and fruit salads."
"A polished, supple Cabernet with real class and style. Drily tannic, it shows a good core of cherries, violets and herbs. Drink soon."
"This easygoing white starts with a fresh nose of grapefruit, fig and flowers and leads into zesty but complex flavors of tropical fruit and citrus. Approachable and balanced, the wine will pair well with seafood and chicken dishes."
"This superpremium effort from Precept Brands is loaded with fruit, and crafted with winemaker Charlie Hoppes' trademark styleâ€”lush oak, giving generous barrel flavors of butterscotch and toast. The barrel flavors dominate, complemented by bold black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit."
"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall."
"Spice, cherry cola and dried lavender emerge from the nose of this classy Riserva. The wine has elegance, harmony and a long finish thanks to the quality of its fruit and the natural acidity. Pair it with lasagna or meat-filled ravioli."
"Pretty standard dry Riesling but done well, marrying bold fruit aromas of apple, pear and melon with undercurrents of spice and minerality. It's medium-bodied, harmonious and shows excellent persistence on the finish."
Silvaners rarely boast this kind of charm and forward fruit. This one combines apple and citrus notes into a round yet crisp package with overtones of pineapple. This should make a refreshing summer sipper.
"The blend includes 6% Pinot Gris. This is a crisp, well-crafted bottle of wine, with more flesh and fruit than the Pine & Post Chardonnay from Precept Brands. Melon, pear, and orange fruit is accented with a little honey; this is a big step forward for this brand."
"Definitely a step up from the regular Chardonnay; this is more substantial, bringing in some mineral, citrus rind and spice along with apple and pear flavors."
"This wine has a rich, velvety character that gives it solo sipping appeal. Pepper and mocha on the nose flow into dark fruit and mocha flavors on the palate. Paired with a good structure and long finish, the wine is both elegant and intriguing."
"Bell's basic Cabernet often is a good buy, and the 2005 certainly falls into that category. It shows polished Napa structure, with savory cassis and cedar flavors. Drink now through 2011."
"Cameron Hughes bottles dozens of wines from California growers, and now he's expanded to include Rioja and Campo de Borja in Spain along with South Africa. This wine is made in the full-throttled, modern style. There's copious oak, toast and darkness on the bouquet, and then full-bodied black plum, raspberry and spice flavors. Quite a bulky, oaky style, but also one endowed with chocolate, nuttiness and depth."
"This special selezione Brunello delivers big ripe fruit flavorsâ€”almost too ripeâ€”of blueberry, strawberry and red currants. The wine has power and heft with more flavors of spice, leather, tobacco and gritty tannins."
"Bramble and red berry aromas are attractive and almost exotic. Feels a bit furry and scratchy, but tastes of blueberry with an herbal tinge. Finishes well, with a pinch of minty green flavor."
"This blend of Catarratto and Chardonnay shows a tiny touch of oxidation, with butterscotch and caramel aromas behind candied fruit, apricot and pineapple. The mouthfeel is soft, thick and sticky."
"Plump, lively and packed tight with cherry and blackberry, this blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot would pair well with grilled sausage or hamburgers. The mouthfeel is soft, easy and fresh."
"This wine opens sweet, smelling of lemon and grapefruit, and is appropriately creamy in mouthfeel, with a sliver of sweetness on the finish."
"Floral and fruity, with abundantly ripe peach and melon flavors, this semidry Riesling is juicy and sweet without being cloying. Penetrating fruit flavors ease off on the midpalate on the way to a dainty, sugar-laced finish."
"Soft and sweet, this Pinot has simple but appealing raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. It would score higher if the texture was more potent."
"This 50-50 blend is easy and drinkable now, with a soft structure of delicate red fruit flavors, light tannins and moderate acidity. An herbal, almost leafy character adds depth to the bouquet. Drink now."
"Waxy floral and lemon skin notes are elegantly subdued on this concentrated semidry Riesling. Juicy on the palate with abundant peach preserve flavors, it finishes moderately long with on a slightly drying, tea inflected note."
"Soft, sweet and fruity, tasting like a granola bar, with roasted almonds, raspberry filling and cinnamon spice."
"Cusumano's fresh Insolia delivers a steady, neutral nose with distant aromas of honey, Golden Delicious apple and dried grass. It's a lean, simple wine at a competitive price."
"Opens with peachy, citric and saline aromas. Feels moderately fresh, but seems as though it's starting to mature as it's fleshy and pithy. Flavors of nectarine, orange and bitter pith are good but lack that ethereal quality that can make AlbariÃ±o special. Drink now."
"There are solid Cabernet flavors of blackberries and black currants in this dry, tannic wine. It's rough and astringent in the mouth, without much charm, but a rich steak, maybe topped with a gorgonzola sauce, will make it shine."
"Whoa... need... water. Michael David's Earthquake is all about impact, no bones about it. And this one won't disappoint people who like their wine like finely aged Scotch, high in alcohol. For them, its bold smoky chocolate, savory bacon on toast notes will be delightful."
Pithoi opens with light aromas of forest berry and raw fruit backed by touches of spice and bitter almond. It's an easy wine that could pair with pizza or take-out fried chicken.
"Lots of zippy acidity in this Chardonnay. Lots of sweetness, too. Tastes like lemon and pineapple pie filling, with heat from the alcohol."
Haermosa is made with organically-farmed fruit. It shows milky notes of peach yogurt and white chocolate. But it also shows zesty crispness on the close despite the thickness and fullness of the wine's overall texture.
"Gritty and rustic, with blackberry, prune and spice flavors. It's a dry, tannic wine, for drinking with simple foods, like burritos."
"Rugged and astringent in texture, with jammy blackberry and spice flavors."
"There's a minty, ammonia streak of greenness that can charitably be described as gooseberry in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Oak brings sweet vanilla richness, but the wine is still pretty eccentric."
"This simple Sicilian red delivers bright berry fruit, blue flower and white almond skin. It shows almost Pinot Noir-like aromas and the power and gritty mouthfeel usually associated with Nero d'Avola."
"A just off-dry Vinho Verde, fresh and spritzy. Acidity, sweet apples and a breezy citrus edge combine easily and lightly. Ready to drink."
"A bit scratchy up front, with some heat and rubber to the bouquet. Feels bold, grippy and alive, with lightly herbal flavors of roasted berry and leather. Herbal and blackened on the finish; ripe but basic in quality."
"On the plus side, the wine is exotic and different, with blueberry, herbal notes, juniper and roasted aromas. But in the mouth, it's lean to the point of being thin, with sharp acidity and tight red plum, pie cherry and herbal flavors. Short on the finish, with tang and scour."
"Stunning aromatically, with a veil of smoke and petrol that lingers over fresh, clean Honeycrisp apple aromas. Semidry in style, with a simple, slightly sugary attack, it finishes with just a tinge of green pepper in the backdrop."
"Terrale Oro is a perfect pasta or pizza wine to drink on nights at home with family and friends. It delivers bright red fruit, blackberry and almond paste."
"A crisp, lemon-scented wine, then layering on butter, toast and ripe melon fruit flavors. It's immediately attractive, not needing any aging, with a soft, yet fresh, finish."
"This is a tart, lean, somewhat ungenerous Pinot Noir, but one that still manages to deliver an attractive, creative tension between its earthy, composty aromas and bright cranberry fruit."
"Enticing aromas of honeysuckle, citrus blossom and stone fruit take shape in the glass. The palate offers juicy pineapple, green apple, white peach, mint and mineral alongside bright acidity."
"Much of the fruit for this wine came from Alexander Valley and it represents the appellation well, combining the ability to be juicy and approachable with powerful tannins and the potential to age. Cassis, raspberry and black pepper are standout characteristics, and the wine is big, but balanced."
"Made with 95% Schiava and 5% Lagrein, this sleek red opens with aromas of red currant and crushed violet. The vibrant palate delivers sour cherry, mandarin orange and almond alongside silky tannins and fresh acidity. This is all about easy-drinking pleasure so enjoy soon."
"Layers of rich white peach and pink grapefruit sweeten this delightfully piercing spÃ¤tlase. It's dainty in mouthfeel, but sumptuously ripe, balanced by a bracing strike of acidity."

"Sleek and polished, this opens with aromas of raspberry preserve and rose petal. The elegant palate offers crushed red berry with hints of green tea, cinnamon and a mineral note alongside firm acidity and supple tannins."
"This vibrant wine opens with varietal aromas of cut grass, passion fruit and crushed tomato vine. The linear palate offers up yellow peach, cantaloupe and a hint of ginger drop alongside racy acidity. It offers excellent value."
"Generous tannins surround a core of ripe, brawny blackberry fruit and a powerful imprint of dried herb in this wine, which is rich and concentrated. Earthy tobacco and chocolate seal the finish."
"Rubbery berry and plum aromas come with a note of latex. In the mouth, this is juicy, bright and focused, with good raspberry and plum fruit. Textural balance is an attribute, while the finish is round, lively and full of tasty berry flavors. Drink through 2018."
"This wine's nose begins very steely, with fresh cracked chalk aromas, then allows soft caramel candy, pound cake and white flowers to emerge. The very inviting flavors include apple flesh and skins, fresh cut pineapple and slated nuts, all clinging to a very pithy element that cuts the entire palate."
"Ripe and fruity, this immediately attractive wine has a crisp texture, giving prominence to apple and grapefruit freshness. The light spritz from bottling from the lees adds bright lift to the aftertaste. Drink now."
"From what are considered as the highest vineyards in Europe, this vibrant, elegant white reveals lovely fragrances of honeysuckle, jasmine and alpine herb. The linear palate delivers yellow apple, citrus, thyme and a hint of mineral alongside brisk acidity."
"This complex, flavorful wine walks on the wild side with a bit of funky barnyard in the aromas and flavors. It's dry, moderately tannic, rather light in body, and brings spicy black pepper, grilled beef and ripe plum flavors."
"Aromas suggest red berry and plum with a hint of cake spice. The palate is elegant and reserved, offering sour cherry, toast and vanilla alongside fine-grained tannins. It closes on a light mineral note."
"This is a successful straight-ahead Chardonnay, with aromas of buttercream, vanilla and orange cake developing complexity thanks to alkaline, pithy notes. For such a rich nose, it proves quite clean and crisp on the palate, with lemon-lime soda, wet slate and just a touch of buttered apples."
"Lightly herbaceous, this is a ripe, lively wine. Grapefruit and lemon zest flavors are complemented by fuller apple and quince flavors. A tight minerality in the background will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2016."
"This is a ripe, fresh and fruity wine that's filled out with a tangy, mineral texture. Grapefruit and lime juice flavors give a zesty feel as well as intense acidity. It is ready to drink."
"Taut and cool with swathes of fresh tarragon and crisp melon rind, this elegant dry Riesling has a nervous vitality throughout. The palate is zesty and bright, highlighting tart flavors of tangerine and apricot before fading into a dusty mineral finish."
"Spine-tingling acidity runs throughout this off-dry Riesling. Swathes of honey and fresh apple, saffron and dried berries lend sweetness and warmth, but this striking kabinett does not surrender its sharp edges easily."
"This blends intensity and nutty richness on the nose, backed up by a full, balanced palate. Flavors of dark caramel, toffee and chocolate end with the distinct flavor of cafÃ© mocha and a lasting streak of caramel."
"Rusty in color and earthy on the nose, with capped aromas of cedar and herbs, this mature Catalonian Cabernet is compact on the palate and fused by firm tannins. Flavors of dried berry, stone fruits and toffee finish long. This ranks as a fun challenge for Spanish wine geeks."
"Light, tart cherry fruit beckons for further exploration. The ripeness is there, and the wine comes across as clean and elegant in its modest proportions. As it breathes open there is a slight hint of volatility which, for most tasters, will be a plus."
"This blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura is initially crisp and fresh. Gradually, it broadens out into a rich wine with a blend between lemon and yellow fruits that is delicious and concentrated. This tangy wine is developing well, and is ready to drink now although it will age."
"This Zin speaks to compelling red fruit, plum and vanilla, with light oak presence. It's balanced yet still plenty big, showing off its well-worn roots within an historic vineyard. Before veering into syrupy territory, it pulls back, letting leathery cinnamon and black pepper have their say."
"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 8% Petite Sirah and 5% Cabernet Franc shows aromas of sweet plum, cherry jam, grape candy and chocolate spices. The palate presents a medium level of density, with flavors of Bing cherry, ollallieberry and dried oregano, thyme and marjoram."
"Floral, this medium-bodied white is creamy and touched by richer notions of pear, pineapple and vanilla, reflective of its warmer appellation in a warm year. French oak (40% of it new) aged the wine for under a year. With a touch of honeysuckle and nutmeg, the minerality is subtle."
"This bright, fresh wine offers aromas of woodland berry, alpine herb, graphite, and a touch of cake spice. On the palate, green tomato and peppermint accent the bright strawberry core."
"A mix of strawberry-rhubarb compote, mocha-chocolate and chalky tannins are featured in this 80% Cabernet with smaller amounts of other Bordeaux varieties blended in. Dense and meaty, a powerful jolt of cassis rears its head on the finish."
"This opens with smoke, mint, coconut, red berry and graphite aromas. The palate offers dried red cherry and mineral alongside drying tannins. Enjoy it soon to capture the fruit flavors."

"A bright, floral fragrance invites one to further explore this softly structured wine. It's layered with ripe red fruit, leather and pepper flavors that are carried into the finish by tight, grippy tannins."
"This lightly built wine is fully expressive, with floral aromas and bright layers of black cherry, peppery clove and toasted oak. Balanced and unhindered, it will work well at the table."
"A considerable step up in quality from the basic Yealands Sauvignon Blanc, this offering boasts attractive aromas of white grapefruit and pea tendrils. There's a silky texture and green, grassy elements on the palate, but they never stray too far into vegetal, finishing zesty and clean."
"Slight reduction still obstructs this wine's nose. The palate, however, is both zingy and richâ€”spiked with citrus and rounded with ripe, mellow apple fruit. There is verve and life at its core and tone to its medium body. The dry finish is appetizing."
"Focused crisp aromas of white fruits reflect a cool vintage. This is roughly one-quarter each Macabeo, Parellada, Xarello and Chardonnay, and it feels tight, fresh and focused. Dry stone-fruit flavors include a hint of lime, while this is clean on the finish."
"Freshly cut pear, ivy leaf and spice mark the nose of this wine. The palate is slender but juicy, full of citrus-fresh fruit. It's all about joy and drinkability, feeling more structured and serious on the clean finish."
"Briny cidery aromas are fortunately not that loud or intense. This is wide and generous on the palate, with dry briny stone-fruit and apple flavors. A sense of dryness and pickle brine is amplified on a purposeful finish."
"Made from 100% estate grapes, this wine is shy in aroma but happily light and bright on the palate. It's delicate yet framed by firm tannins, showing blueberry and toasty oak flavors and nuanced acidity."
"Tangy boysenberry and elderberry fruit shows on the nose of this sultry bottling, along with thyme, potpourri and licorice. The flavors are more cooked than fresh, recalling charred blackberry, dried blueberry, leather and licorice. It's a hearty wine that consumes the entire palate."
Waxy lightly toasted aromas of yellow apple are more subtle than popping. This barrel-fermented wine offers good weight and balance along with quiet flavors of spiced apple and vanilla. A sophisticated clean finish is lightly oaked in flavor and smooth in feel.
"This plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay shows yellow fruit notes of mirabelle plum, peach and pineapple, all wrapped in a cocoon of woodsmoke. Drink nowâ€“2020."
"Woodsmoke, bramble and sharp raspberry sorbet aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend from winemaker Kevin Law and actress Challen Cates. Sour cranberry and tart plum skin flavors show on the palate, along with darker nutmeg-like spices."
"The estate wine of Coutinel is dominated by the local NÃ©grette grape. With the addition of 15% Syrah and (unusual for this part of the world) 15% Gamay, the wine is structured while also juicy. Soft tannins and black fruits are shot through with an attractive perfumed character. Drink from 2018."
"From organically grown grapes, this firmly structured red wine is stalky while also rich with potential. It is young, dense with tannins as well as black-currant fruit. The wine will need to age, so drink from 2019."
"This ripe wine from a very fine vintage in Bergerac, is fully structured while also having a fine black-currant fruitiness. Half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it has a perfumed edge along with rich juicy acidity and fruits. Drink this fine wine from late 2017."
"Pascal Savoret is the only producer with vines actually in the village (as distinct from the appellation) of Madiran, a mere population of 430. He has produced a dense and tannic wine, packed with woody dark tannins. The black fruits and concentrated dusty texture promise further aging for this Tannat wine. Drink from 2020."
"Meat, compost and leather notes mark the entry of this Syrah blended with smaller amounts of MourvÃ¨dre and Petite Sirah. Light black pepper and red fruit flavors are sustained by a soft, round texture and lingering finish."
This highly aromatic Sauvignon Blanc dishes out loads of pretty white peach and yellow cherry flavors backed by a bristling streak of acidity. It's a vibrant yet satisfyingly full-bodied wine with a pristine grapefruit finish. Drink now through 2020.
"Deep penetrating sour-cherry and raspberry flavors are balanced against brisk blood-orange acidity in this dry Pinot Noir rosÃ©. Full bodied and slightly silky on the palate, it's a satisfyingly mouthfilling but invigorating wine to enjoy now through the fall months."
"This perennially delicious blend brings together 53% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 12% MourvÃ¨dre. It lets each variety speak, offering a structured expression of juicy strawberry, mint and balanced ripeness. Despite its nuances, it's not afraid to be bold."
"Elegant, savory and balanced, this opens with delicate orchard fruit, Mediterranean scrub and wet stone scents. The vibrant, ethereal palate delivers lemon, nectarine and pear fruit, buttressed by crisp acidity. A savory mineral note gives it a mouthwatering finish."
"This blend of Cinsault, Grenache and Syrah is attractively fruity. It has a crisp texture that gives it a bright character, red-currant fruitiness and intense refreshing acidity. The aftertaste is elegant and fruity. The wine's name (meaning to dare) is an anagram of RosÃ©. Drink now."
"This is a ripe, full and fruity wine. It is packed with attractive red-berry fruits and a crisp dry backbone. The acidity and the bright aftertaste make it a fine food rosÃ©. It comes from a small appellation surrounded by the large CÃ´tes de Provence area."
"Produced from organic grapes, the wine is ripe and packed with fruit. It has a delicious line of acidity, as well as weight and peach and red-fruit flavors. The acidity keeps the exuberance in check. Drink now."
"Fresh Conference pear notes abound on the nose of this wine. The palate is sprightly and fresh, with a zestier core of lime and pear peel. Slender in frame, it dances on the palate, displaying seriousness and levity at the same time. The finish is totally refreshing."
"Blackberry and chocolate flavors intertwine nicely in this soft, round and bright red from a tiny site in the appellation. Lightly spiced with clove and cedar, it strikes a balance between fruit and tension, making it a food-friendly option that won't overpower in the glass."
"Damp chaparral, dried blueberry, beef and pencil lead scents show on the nose of this blend of 54% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 11% MourvÃ¨dre. Rounded blueberry and black plum flavors meet loamy soil, anise, thyme and marjoram spice, with a savory touch of smoke."
"Spanish broom, yellow stone fruit and citrus zest aromas take shape in the glass. Lively acidity carries juicy nectarine, intense lemon, thyme, pineapple and Mediterranean herb flavors into the round, juicy finish."
"Intense and loaded with scents and flavors of fully ripe fruit, this parades down the tree fruit and tropical fruit avenues, with peach, apricot, papaya and mango in the lead. It's a delicious bottle, with just enough acidity to keep it bright and lively."
"This is herbal and clipped smelling, with a scattering of berry and plum notes. It feels saturated and chewy, with roasted berry, pepper and spice flavors that lead to a lightly herbal finish, with a rubbery accent and a baked fruit note."
"An easy-drinking rosato, this has dusty aromas of dried rose petal, stone fruit and citrus. The mouthfeel is clean, lean and crisp."
"Regrettably, this has no sweetness scale on the back label, but the 11.5% alcohol suggests that it is off-dry, as it certainly tastes. It's a heavy, honey-soaked style, perhaps due to grapes that were affected by botrytis. Apple juice and honey flavors are right in the heart of this wine, which would pair well with a simple dessert of fresh fruit."
"Zibibbo is usually presented as a passito dessert wine, but this is dry. The natural floral fragrance of the variety emerges on the nose, while the mouthfeel and the honey and peach flavors are detailed with acids."
"This is a lean, compact expression of Falanghina, opening with bright citrus, pear and kiwi aromas. It delivers fresh acidity and a bright, easygoing personality."
"New wood dominates this soft wine. The fruit is round and smoky, featuring notes of black cherries and red plums that fall behind a toasty caramel sweetness. It needs several months for the wood influence to integrate."
"Spicy, creamy new-wood aromas introduce a wine that is heavily dominated by woody tannins. The wine is very dry, its fruit a mere whisper in the background. Give this five years and the fruit may come forward, though that's not a guarantee."
"An attractively fragrant rosÃ©, this is very crisp and clean. It has lively raspberry and red currant flavors that are lightly touched by a herb note. A bright finish completes this refreshing wine."
"Strong in black currant, raisin, blackberry pie and oaky flavors, this full-bodied effort has thick tannins. It's pleasant for drinking now with barbecue and roasts."
"This mix of 62% Pepper Bridge Vineyard Syrah and 38% Klipsun Vineyard Malbec has not entirely come together. The grapey fruit flavors and slightly stemmy tannins may ultimately complement each other, but that will require more bottle age. For the moment, give it a good decanting, or wait a couple more years before opening."
"Dry and firm, this is smothered with hard-edged tannins that give the wine a tough character. It will soften a little bit, but not completely."
"This Navarran Garnacha is more interesting, offering lemony, floral aromas that are red in nature and not very stout. The palate sizzles with racy acidity, while the flavor profile is pure and tangy, with cranberry and red plum notes. A zesty style of Grenache."
"This Rioja opens with a jumpy, lively, candied red-fruit aroma. It feels solid, rubbery and stout, with dark fruit flavors that are accented by mild resin and butter notes. Feels a little sticky on the finish, with firm tannins."
"A fairly lean Pinot, this lacks voluptuousness, but it's dry and crisp, with fine cherry, cranberry, tobacco and pepper flavors. Give it some airing and drink now."
"It's hard to get around the tannins that battle in this wine, which is savory and dark with a smoky aura. Lay it down another couple of years or let it air out a bit before pouring."
"Using fruit that was sourced from the vineyards of Feudo Arancio near the town of Sambuca in southern Sicily, this pretty white wine offers bright aromas of lemon, green apple and cut grass. A long list of seafood menu items would pair with this Grillo."
"A blend of Viognier, Grenache Blanc, Marasanne and Roussanne, this is very generous, offering orange, pear, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors. However, the oak seems a little heavy-handed."
"â€œSangue Blu,â€ which translates to â€œblue blood,â€ offers sun-drenched aromas of ripe fruit and rum cake that are backed by tobacco and sweet Indian spice notes. The mouthfeel is textured, gritty and rich."
"Here's a solid, dark wine, with an old wood character. It has weight, a black plum flavor and dark tannins. This feels old and hard."
"There's a slightly confected top-note of cotton candy or bubble gum to this wine, but also decent concentration of canteloupe and peach fruit aromas and flavors. It's plump and medium-bodied, with a touch of refreshing minerality on the finish."
Lavender and licorice on the nose; the palate mixes shy black cherry and cassis flavors with a bit of Chile's patented leafy character. The finish is round and offers a touch of vanilla and mocha. For the money this is solid and very easy to drink.
"This is smoky and minerally upfront, influenced by barrel notes, but there's also some intense strawberry and raspberry fruit on the palate and a minerally reprise on the concentrated finish."
"A nice, dry Chard, a bit on the earthy, tobaccoey side, with pleasantly acidic mineral flavors and hints of lemons, limes and pineapples."
"A luminous Italian white wine offersing subdued tones of stone fruit, white mineral and honey. There's an aromatic component that is reminiscent of mint and the wine is clean and easy in the mouth with a vibrant, fresh finish."
"Bonterra's first rosÃ©, showing the clean purity and balance that nearly always characterize its wines. Bone dry and vibrant in acidity, this Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Grenache blend has tart cherry, raspberry, tea and vanilla flavors. You might want to open it early to let some sulfur blow off."
"Intriguing all around, this displays earthy notes of truffle and meat on the nose, and balanced flavors of full raspberry and spicy caramel on the palate. Though a touch angular, the wine has elegance and good fruit."
"This is a very fragrant and pungent Pinot Bianco with aromas of exotic fruit, pineapple, apricot and melon. It represents a lighter, fresher take on the robust grape and delivers a medium, compact structure in the mouth."
"This mountain-grown Zin is dry, lusty, robust and briary, with peppery flavors of wild forest berries, leather and cola. You'll find firm acids, but the wine has a silky texture that's almost like Pinot Noir."
"Made in a soft, gentle way, this pretty MourvÃ¨dre has chocolate-infused blackberry, currant, raspberry, licorice, cola and pepper flavors. It's very dry, and will drink well with a char-broiled steak."
"Slightly confected on the nose, showing cotton candy and bubble gum aromas, but you'll also find plenty of strawberry-raspberry flavors. Very fruity and clean, with a fresh finish."
"More tannic, drier and more acidic than most fine coastal Syrahs, this one from the Sierra Foothills is marked by its firm structure.The black currant, licorice, beef jerky and tobacco flavors are complex. Best now."
"Ripe, fruity wine with quince and pineapple flavors, layered through with apple skin tannins. It could do with six months aging, but it will certainly be ready to drink by the fall."
"This austere and lightly herbal Cabernet is balanced and varietal, but at first seems a bit dull, as if tasted through a screen. That said, it actually improved after 24 hours, with more presence to the tart red and black fruits. It's an elegant style that will probably show best with food."
"This is a robust, dense wine, showing the hot character of the vintage in its aromas and flavors of fruitcake and spice and slightly rough texture. It's a blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Cabernet, matured in one-third new oak."
"This is a blush wine made primarily from the Spanish variety, Tempranillo. It's fairly dark for a rosÃ© and quite full-bodied in cherry jam, pepper and vanilla flavors, while a splash of AlbariÃ±o adds needed acidity and the bright taste of citrus."
"A little sugary-sweet, but the acidity is so crisp and clean, it balances things out. The pineapple, papaya, peach jam, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors are really delicious."
"A good but awkward attempt at a bigger, more saturated, more serious wine. The nose tells you that it's ripe, but there's some reduction in there too. The palate is revved up and tannic with turbulence along the way. Spice, chocolate and heat all play a part on the berry-driven palate."
"Verdelho is one of those new varieties imported from old Europe that's providing a badly needed shot in the arm for California, namely, the need for crisply acidic, dry whites. It's a zesty, refreshing wine, with lemon-honey, peach and vanilla flavors."
"This is richer than most Pinot Grigios. It opens with aromas of toast, yellow flower, vanilla and a balsamic note while the round, full-bodied palate offers baked yellow apple, candied lemon drop, nectarine zest and almond. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy fruit while a vanilla note closes the finish. You can barely detect the warmth of alcohol on the close."
"Crisp, cutting lime and lemon lend verve to crisp green apple and pear flavors in this fruity, fresh Riesling. It's approachable and refreshing, slicked with subtle honey and spice tones. The finish is brisk and clean."
"The high alcohol is a good indication of the ultraripe fruit flavors here. Raisins and cooked cherries dominate, set against a background of tart cherry-pie acids. The concentration is impressive, as is the purity of the fruit flavors."
"This lively white opens with aromas of peach blossom, crushed stone and whiff of toasted nut while the linear palate shows yellow peach, lemon zest and vibrant acidity. A mineral note closes the finish."
"Light and clear in color, this wine veers into cool-climate, restrained territory in its well-defined lines of sage, dried herb and stemmy earth. Dry tannins give an oomph of power beneath traces of dried rose."
"The nose of this Chenin is light and dainty, with soft scents of toast, orange blossom, pear and white peach that dance in the glass. The palate is a bit more assertive, showing ripe flavors of pear and peach purÃ©e alongside a pleasant citric lift that refreshes the finish. Drink now."
"An underlying richness and toasty character grounds the upfront aromas of citrus pith, green apple and pineapple core. Accessible and friendly, the structure is soft and easy, with medium acidity and light flavors of ripe pear flesh, honeydew and creamed orange. A hint of peach-pit nuttiness graces the medium-length finish. Drink now."
"Delicate scents of elderflower and orchard fruit mix in the glass while the lively palate offers rennet apple, citrus zest and a whiff of nutmeg. Crisp acidity brightens the juicy flavors."
"Cola, black cherry and crushed purple flowers show on the nose of this bottling, one of the first reds to emerge from the 2014 vintage. It's light and energetic on the palate, with tangy cranberry juice and a touch of licorice."
"An uncommon source grape for pink wine, this Nebbiolo shows lemon juice and watermelon on the rather rich and inviting nose. The palate's grippy texture packs flavors of strawberry fruit and lime zest, with acidic energy that would make a perfect pairing for fried chicken or heartier fish."
"This screaming violet-colored chunkster is big and blocky up front, with aromas of vitamins and grapy black fruits. A giant palate holds big tannins, while heady flavors of black plum and oak spice finish minty, toasty and with power."
"Rare to find on its own, as it's mainly used in sparkling-wine blends, this Pinot Meunier is earthy in dark truffle and herb, more savory, dry flavors that are wrapped in tightly woven tannins and oak. The muted fruit that's there recalls sweet raspberry."
"Dark-berry aromas meet hints of menthol and game on the nose. The medium-bodied palate follows suit on entry, but becomes lighter by the midpalate from a slick of minerality. Pair alongside gamy meats such as grilled venison loin."
"This LBV from the Bulas family vineyards, downriver from PinhÃ£o is all ready to drink. It is fruity with just the right amount of structure. Fresh berry fruits are lifted by fine acidity and well integrated into the smooth, just tannic structure. Drink now."
"Flavors of pressed apple and pears are uncomplicated but pleasing in this sprightly off-dry Riesling. While delicately framed, it's punchy and penetrating, finishing with a lingering apple-cider sweetness. Drink now through 2017."
"Varietal scents of cut grass, grapefruit and a hint of tomato vine come forward on this vibrant white. The racy palate offers gooseberry, kiwi and a note of green bell pepper that lead up to a tangy finish."
"This is a fruity, juicy wine that has a dry tanninc core. That gives a mineral texture to the otherwise ripe and fruity wine. Full of black currant fruit flavors, shot through with acidity, the wine is ready to drink."
"With 26 months in small oak barrels, aromas of coconut cream, finely ground sawdust and cherry stems ride over condensed black cherry and currant. The medium-weight palate has a plush feel to it, offering a balance of ripe berry fruit and zesty streaks of minerals."
"Aromas of orchard fruit, nut and a light whiff of toast lift from the glass. The medium-bodied, straightforward palate offers pear, apple and a note of lemon drop. Vibrant acidity gives it a clean finish."
"This lively white opens with aromas of grapefruit, light oak and crushed rock. On the racy palate, zesty acidity underscores yellow peach, citrus zest, ginger and a hint of vanilla. A hint of mineral marks the finish."
"Inviting aromas of toasted almond, pear and a whiff of chopped herb lead the nose on this linear white. The lively palate offers crisp apple, nectarine zest and flinty mineral accompanied by bright acidity."
"This is an unusual commingling of mostly Rhone varieties, a mix of 75% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 12% Marsanne, with the addition of 3% SÃ©millon. Honeycomb and Nilla wafer rise from the nose before a medium-bodied swirl of sour lemon, grapefruit and yuzu give it tartness on the finish."
"This big but balanced wine has melon and apple aromas, lots of fruit and toasty oak in the flavors, and a super-smooth and rich texture. The finish lingers."
"Grapefruit, peach and nectarine aromas carry over to the racy palate along with apricot. Zesty acidity provides refreshing balance and a tangy finish."
"This linear wine opens with aromas that suggest tomato vine, white spring flower and yellow grapefruit that carry over to the crisp palate along with a hint of zesty lemon peel. Racy acidity adds even more verve."
"Opaque and thick, this soft, black peppery wine is ripe and bright in clove, crisp red currant and cranberry, with a streak of eucalyptus-like mint. It finishes in a subtle flourish of cedar and tar."
"Aromas of pressed apples and pears turn fleshier and riper on the palate of this forward, concentrated Riesling. Sumptuous peach and apricot flavors amass a honeyed sweetness on the midpalate, balanced neatly by squirts of tangerine acidity. It's an approachable, fruity wine to drink now through 2017."
"The dark color and high acidity of this wine are both typical of the SousÃ£o grape which is normally found only in Douro blends. It is ripe, fruity and juicy although with tight acidity and black currant fruits. The wine's tannins suggest it needs to age, so drink from 2017."
"The balance between wood aging and fruit is at its best in this wine. It shows plenty of red fruits filled out with raisins and nutmeg. As a contrast the wood aging has brought out a spicy, almond character. It is fresh, on the dry side for an aged tawny and, of course, ready to drink."
"While big and brawny in style, this Pinot still maintains good balance. The aromas resemble toasty, spicy oak, with cranberry and dark cherry notes. The flavors echo the nose and are vivid due to lively acidity and a firm layer of tannins."
"Big, full bodied and concentrated, this is a ripe, rich wine. Ripe plum flavors are balanced with nervy acidity and dense tannins. This is a wine that will still need to age, so don't drink before 2017."
"This is a remarkably spicy wine that is also finely balanced. It's sophisticated as well as rich, with spice and lychee flavors lifted by a crisp edge of acidity. It's complex in texture and should age well. Drink from 2015."
"This is a medium-sweet wine that's warm and rich due to the ripening abilities of the Spiegel vineyard. It is spiced, concentrated and full of a smoky character that contrasts with its fruitiness. It's ready to drink now, although it will certainly age well. Drink until 2019."
"The cool vintage was a challenge, which speaks well of the winery's vineyard team. Blended with 5% Petite Sirah, the wine is unusually complex and sumptuous, even by Dry Creek standards. The flavors are rich with wild summer blueberries and blackberries, and savory with pepper and other exotic spices."
"The sixteenth edition of Dunham's benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon bears a strong scent of new oakâ€”it's aged in 70% French and 30% American. The wood is dominant, which is not surprising in a wine built for long term aging. Given plenty of time to breathe, bright red fruits, citrusy acids and a lovely mix of toast, caramel and clove accents emerge."
"Richly aromatic, on the strength of the nose alone this could pass for something from Napa's Rutherford Bench. The blue and purple fruit notes and dusty tannins all say California, but the laser-like definition, minerality and natural acidity prove it's Washington fruit all the way. Strikingly dense and complex, with decades of life ahead."
"Sourced entirely from the Sagemoor vineyard, this richly endowed Viognier smothers the palate in a lush mix of fat, candied citrus and tropical fruits. Honeysuckle and orange pekoe tea flavors trickle into the lingering, lip-smacking finish."
"Sweet and rich, this is a wine that combines honey with a touch of toast and smokiness. The mid palate is filled with apricot and fresh lemon flavors. There is a fine acidity on the finish that gives a delicious lift."
"Alluring white-pepper spice, with nuances of dried thyme and seductive cherry fruit, make this a compelling choice with more depth than force. This is subtle and velvety, quietly convincing and very long. Firm yet ripe tannins provide structure and ageability. This will be even more elegant with a few years of cellaring; drink 2016â€“2020."
"The 2005 and 2006 bottlings of this Cabernet were awesome. So is this 2007. At the age of more than six years, it's just beginning its long journey. It's still tannic, but with ripe, sweet tannins that frame gorgeous, deeply satisfying blueberry, black currant, mocha and cedar flavors. It drinks well now, and will develop further in the bottle over the next eight years."
"Sourced principally from Klipsun, with smaller amounts from Champoux and Seven Hills, this tight, dark, richly-flavored wine has impeccable credentials. Black fruits, espresso and citrusâ€”notably blood orangeâ€”mingle seamlessly, though it takes some hours to open up. The Red Mountain fruit contributes characteristic notes of iron ore and underlying minerality."
"Red cherry fruit, with edges of white pepper, plays charmingly on both the nose and palate. The svelte figure of the wine belies its depth: this has subtle, Burgundian virtues and earthy undertones that provoke stimulating conversation and thought. An ideal accompaniment for subtle, nuanced dishes or a really good book."
"This is a textured wine with ripe and perfumed fruitiness. Honeyed in style and medium-sweet on the palate, it's a complex, rich wine that's ready to drink now, but could also improve with age."
"Richly sweet, this is a wine that has traded primary fruitiness with deliciously balanced honey flavor and lively citrus acidity. It's a wine that has richness, intense flavor and the ability to age further."
"Coming on the heels of the extraordinary 2009 vintage, this '10 is a worthy followup. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of blackberry, currant, cola, new oak and spice flavors. It's so good now, you may not want to cellar it, but try. It will begin to approach its peak after 2017."
"The 85% of Cabernet Sauvignon is upfront, with Syrah providing an accent. It's tightly wound, with notes of dusty cherry, sautÃ©ed herbs and spices, and tart cranberries supported by chewy, firm tannins that need time in the cellar to come into their own. Best after 2017."
"Caldwell managed to wrest plenty of blackberry and cherry fruit into this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, even though the vintage was a tough one. The wine, aged in 80% new French oak, is elaborate and opulent, but the tannins are strong, giving the palate a lockdown astringency. It should age well though and your window of drinking begins in 2019."
"This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth. A fresh mix of citrus and stone, this elevates Viognier into the top echelons of Washington white wines."
"Firm and tannic in structure, this is a wine for aging. Ripe, dark fruits add power and a density of texture. Drink from 2016."
"Structured and firm, this is a tight wine with powerful, youthful acidity as well as a dense structure and dark tannins. It has weight as well, indicating a wine with excellent aging potential. Drink from 2016."
"A blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, this is a dense and brooding wine, with dark notes of cassis, licorice, black plum, date and cigar-box spice on the nose and in the mouth. The palate is firmly structured, with medium tannins and balanced alcohol that lend the wine a crushed-velvet texture. Glimmers of charred oak and toasted spice linger long on the finish. Delicious now, but should develop more layer and nuance with time; drink through 2018."
"The 2010 Bello Rosso sticks to the 50-50 Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon formula, with a full, round, ripe and balanced palate. Fruity and forward, with citrus-accented cherry fruit, it pulls together the strengths of both grapes, with taut acidity and firm tannins."
"This sources grapes from the oldest (1972) blocks at Sagemoor, yielding a deep, rich and intense wine saturated with black cherry, cassis, licorice and barrel flavors. It's perfectly balanced, drinking beautifully, and fit for cellaring over a decade or longer."
"Dense and structured, this is a wine with good potential. It has weight, concentrated tannins and ripe fruit, as well as a solid, full-bodied feel. The palate is marked with power, a fine mineral texture and great acidity on the finish. Drink from 2017."
"A hint of mossy undergrowth leads on the nose, while lovely notes of white-pepper dusted green and yellow pear unfold on the soft, rounded palate. Those looking for texture as well as flavor will not be disappointed. Those who have the patience to cellar this will be rewarded with complex, mature flavors and great concentration. Drink 2016â€“2020."
"This is the first vintage for Uprightâ€”100% Klipsun Vineyard and 100% varietal Merlot. Thick and syrupy, it's a full throttle wine, with deep flavors of berry, cherry and cassis. Red licorice lightly streaks through the back end, and the wine makes a smooth landing on a strip of Bourbon barrel notes."
"Sourced from a vineyard high up in the Mayacamas, on the Sonoma County side, this wine is intense with mountain grown fruit. The palate is full of ripe black currants, mocha and plenty of toasty oak. The tannins, while soft and pliant, are penetrating. All indications are of a wine that wants time in the cellar. Drink from 2016 till well beyond."
"Very subtle but ultimately seductive wild cherry notes captivate on the nose, while the body is luscious, rounded, generous and inviting, without an ounce of fat. There are hints of clove and anise, a deep, mellow cherry core and haunting floral hints. Drink 2015â€“2020."
"Brooding flavors of dark cherry and pure cocoa initially play on the palate, but it slowly opens up to reveal a deceptive lightness. The body is sleek yet concentrated, with super-soft tannins. With haunting edges of cherries preserved in kirsch and bitter chocolate, this is an intriguing, elegant wine that's lovely now but will also age gracefully through 2019."
"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% MourvÃ¨dre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity."
"A partnership between the Delicato Family and country musician Zac Brown, this well-made wine shows a wealth of flavor and complexity, from dusty saddle and earth to black cherry and berry. Muscular and dense, it reveals plenty of underlying structure and grace, with a bright sprinkling of spicy pepper on the finish. Drink ideally between 2020 and 2023."
BouscassÃ© is the home of Alain Brumont who also owns ChÃ¢teau Montus in Madiran. This powerful wine with its blend of Tannat with the two Cabernets (Franc and Sauvignon) is dense and packed with firm tannins. It is also equally full of generous black-plum fruits and considerable acidity. This is still youngâ€”it's a concentrated wine that needs to age further. Drink from 2019.
"Crisp and packed with lively lemon-like acidity, this wine shows both minerality and intense fruitiness. Textured and tight, it has hints of yellow fruit in the background that will blossom as the wine develops. Drink from 2021."
"This deeply impressive blend of 20 different varieties comes from a vineyard at the top of the Gaivosa estate that was oddly ignored for many years. With black plum fruit, dense tannins and intense acidity, it's built for longterm aging. Drink from 2021."
"2014 proves another banner year for this delightful blend of SÃ©millon from Monte Rosso Vineyard, Muscadelle from Pagani Ranch and Palomino and Muscadelle from Saitone Ranch. High-toned in tart, refreshing acidity, it offers hints of vanilla biscuit with its lime, apple and melon flavors, lingering in memory for days."
"Purists will no doubt object to this wine's fine patina of sophisticated, cedary oak, but there's plenty of high-quality fruit to back it up. Incorporating unusual proportions of 44% Grenache, 33% MourvÃ¨dre and 23% Syrah, the fruit is ripe and lush, velvety-supple and medium to full in weight, without any sense of heaviness. Drink 2020â€“2030."
"From one of the highest premier cru vineyards comes a wine that has a cool edge, generous fruit and firm tannins. Those elements come together with black cherry flavors and a dry core, promising a serious future. Drink from 2023."
"This wine manages to combine firm structure with the finely perfumed fruit associated with Chambolle-Musigny. It's rich, fruity, lifted by acidity and held together by solid tannins. Impressive and full bodied, it's a wine to age. Drink from 2024."
"Underbrush, truffle, crushed herb and ripe black-skinned fruit aromas slowly take shape along with a waft of new leather. The bold palate shows mature black cherry, licorice, clove and tobacco framed in big velvety tannins. This is already tempting but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2020â€“2027."
"This dense and structured wine comes from a small walled vineyard within the larger Les Vignes Franches premier cru, partially owned by Louis Jadot. Robust tannins frame its rich, juicy black fruit, showing potential for long aging. Drink from 2024."
"Baked plum, baking spice, blue flower and pipe tobacco meld together with earthy aromas of new leather and a whiff of underbrush on this impressive wine. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, dark chocolate and star anise. Firm velvety tannins envelope the palate. Drink 2019â€“2029."
"The winery's characteristic dense style is immediately apparent in this blend of 54% Syrah, 21% MourvÃ¨dre, 16% Grenache and 9% Petite Sirah. It offers black licorice, smoked meat, baked black cherry and graphite aromas, needing time to breathe before unleashing black coffee, elderberry jam, asphalt and charcoal flavors through tarry tannins. Drink 2018â€“2028."
"From a 22-acre site in the middle of the appellation, this is an impressive wine, softened by the addition of 6% Merlot. It boasts crushed rock, black currant and licorice flavors, with an attractive sanguine note. Pencil shavings, black pepper and cigar accents are present throughout."
"Initial whiffs of smoke and struck flint fade into pretty pineapple and blossom on the nose of this full-bodied, dry Riesling. Mango and tangerine flavors are riper and heftier on the palate than in many of the Mosel's 2015 Grosses GewÃ¤chs wines, neatly balanced by racy acidity and a backbone of cool steel. It's delicious already, but likely to evolve well through the 2020s at least."
"Named after the 15th century owner of this estate, the wine comes from a selection of the best parcels. With impressive tannins, a dense structure and rich bold black fruits, this is a powerful wine. It is full of ripe fruit with a mineral texture and has a good future. Drink from 2021."
"This wine from Rick Grimm and winemaker Paul Lato shows stunning potential for this new vineyard. Blackberry, thyme, black pepper and crushed slate aromas lead to a tremendously savory, umami-packed palate, where bay leaf and stewed mushroom notes envelop a core of blackberry and black currant fruit. The structure is solid, and the finish is long and strong."
"At first shy and brooding, this slowly opens up in the glass, offering aromas of black-skinned berry, blue flower, licorice and flint. The palate has concentration and finesse, boasting chewy black cherry, blackberry, chopped mint, anise and mineral alongside firm acidity and lithe tannins. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017â€“2023."
"This is a standout, showing Napa Valley's true potential for the variety. Steely and light bodied in approach, it offers a lively complement of apricot and juicy green-apple flavors, finishing on a fresh fig note and feeling balanced and complete."
"Aromas of forest floor, baked plum, clove and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers fleshy wild cherry, raspberry, star anise, tobacco and nutmeg alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2018â€“2024."
"This wine comes from a vineyard owned by the Gagey situated in the northern part of Nuits-Saint-Georges, close to Vosne-RomanÃ©e. It has firm structure and a perfumed character that is already enticing. Richly fruity with juicy acidity, it will be impressive as it ages. Drink from 2023."
"From a warm-climate zone in a cool vintage, this wine is fascinatingly savory. Black and white pepper, game meat, crushed graphite and espresso aromas promise an awesome sip. It delivers with black peppercorn, green olive, black plum skin and elderberry flavors."
"From the historic Herdade do MouchÃ£o in northern Alentejo, this is a powerful wine, full of dense tannins and impressively ripe, juicy black fruits. Syrah and Alicante Bouschet bring southern richness to Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional. Drink this wine now."
"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot. Spicy with clove scents, it showcases deep cassis and cranberry flavors, with a lift of red fruit and supportive acidity."
"Plump but sour cranberry fruit aromas meet with sweet sandalwood, clove and forest floor on the nose of this San Francisco-made bottling from the historic property. Sanguine touches on the palate lead to raspberry, cherry, cinnamon and juniper flavors, ending in a menthol finish."
"The partner label of Black Cordon, also made by consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs, this entry-level offering blends small amounts of all the red Bordeaux varieties and ages in 80% new French oak. Tar and graphite scents and bold, soft acidity support juicy black and red berry flavors, with a shock of anise. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033."
"From an estate vineyard, this impressive wine is earthy with tobacco leaf and juicy cherry and cassis notes. Soft, supple and lengthy, it lingers on the palate as a well-integrated, balanced and beautifully crafted expression of the grape."
"Extremely luscious on the nose, this bottling is redolent of baked black cherries, vanilla, smoke and wet riverstones. That fruit-forward style carries over to the palate, with cherry pie and baking spice flavors, backed by a solid and an expertly balanced acidity that holds those rich flavors in check."
"Mature plum, ripe berry, baking spice, underbrush and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied wine. On the chewy palate, notes of cinnamon, clove and licorice add depth to dried cherry and raspberry. Velvety tannins give it just enough tension and texture. Drink 2018â€“2024."
"This varietal Cabernet Sauvignon hails from the producer's organic Chiles Valley estate. It's muscular and lushly layered, with spicy leather and tobacco notes accented by a delicate touch of violet and supported by firm, grippy tannin. Drink now through 2033."
"There's no shortage of heavily charred oak, and early on it may seem a bit mulchy and leathery. But as it knits together and the fruit rises, you'll see that there's a compact, serious wine laying in wait. Flavors of blackberry, licorice and herbs are authentic and powerful. Clacky tannins make food almost mandatory."
"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino is a simple, fruit-forward wine with loads of red cherry, blueberry, cedar wood and exotic spice. It has a gritty, spicy mouthfeel and big, powerful tannins."
"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck."
"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short."
"A solid wine with a good mix of herbal, cola and red-fruit aromas. It deals spanking red fruit flavors and a sprinkle of vanilla and chocolate on the racy finish. For a short, fresh and clean wine, Aresti's Cab makes the grade."
"This 60-40 blend features gentle aromas of vanilla and cassis in a medium-bodied, creamy-smooth format. It's not powerful or complex, but offers pure cassis and vanilla flavors tinged with chocolate on the finish. Good value."
"Big, bold, wild and dark, with mild burnt aromas backed by broad blackberry and plum flavors. This represents the fruity, thick style of Syrah, with additional notes of black olive and savory meat pie. It's not flawless but its pounding fruit character will earn its share of fans."
"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua. The nose is pithy and citric, and the palate is more of the same. Good mouthfeel and fresh, but green, citrusy and too much like Sauvignon Blanc."
"With quite a bit of residual sugar, this Riesling is sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity that makes it clean and zesty. The flavors are of peaches, apricots, candied ginger, honeysuckle and vanilla. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink."
"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along."
"A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste."
"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetalâ€”green peaâ€”flavors. Still, there's enough passion fruit and grapefruit to provide a sense of balance and a crisp, clean finish."
"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine."
"The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews. Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless."
"Shows a beautiful Pinotesque mouthfeel, all silk and satin, with that elegant Carneros acidity. But the flavors could be more concentrated. The cherries, cola and pomegranates feel a little watered down."
"This is a bold and powerful wine with distinctive green notes that recall dried grass, black pepper and spice. It also has bitter chocolate, cardamom and cumin and its tannins are so strong, they literally leave your palate parched and dry."
"Here's a delicate, feminine Sangiovese with a thin consistency and mature aromas of forest berry, raspberry, black olive and spice. It's a bit thorny in places with sour notes on the finish but it would pair well with pasta or pizza."
"Offers herb, cranberry and cherry aromas upfront, followed by a medium-bodied palate that's cedary and herbal, but also shows some chunky cherry fruit. Finishes on oaky notes of coffee and chocolate."
"Here's a lean, almost colorless, citrus-driven Grigio from sunny Umbria that has a bit of candy and cola on its sweet, fragrant nose. There are peppermint renderings and dried hay in the background. It's watery and lean in the mouth and would pair with appetizers or simple vegetable dishes."
"A soft, easy-to-drink Pinot Noirâ€”even for Marlborough. Tannins are developed and supple, while the flavors lean toward caramel, cherry and sandalwood. Drink now."
"Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough."
"Made from authentic Port varieties, this dessert wine is quite sweet. The residual sugar is about 9.5%, giving a honeyed finish to the blackberry and chocolate flavors. It doesn't have the complexity for aging, so drink now."
"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon, this tannic, dry wine has flavors of cherries, vanilla and smoky oak. It may develop some additional complexities over time."
"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy."
"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature."
"This Pinot Grigio is a bit more fragrant and floral in essence with aromas of stone fruit and peach blossom. It has a fresh, almost piquant edge but it also has that characteristic watery mouthfeel you'll likely encounter with this variety."
"The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character. Along the way there's floral berry aromas, cherry and plum flavors, and finishing notes of root beer, chocolate and cough drops. A bit woody and tannic but it gets the job done."
"Among the greatest expressions of Fiano, Cometa is a full and generous effort, with deep layers of passion fruit and stone fruit, plus touches of vanilla, honey and light spice. The concentration and freshness is wonderful, and the wine would pair well with steamed lobsters or buttery crab legs."
"Lush and opulent, this shows complex flavors of cherry compote, raspberry jam, date and exotic spice. Thoroughly dry on the finish, this drinks well right now. It offers a delicacy that's sometimes missing in Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs. From Hess Collection."
"Really easy to like now for its silky approachability, and for the way the flavors gather upfront and through the long, spicy finish. Polished and crisp, it has flavors of raspberries, cherries, tart cranberries and ripe pomegranates. The fruit is sourced from the cool, southern part of the Russian River Valley."
"Despite the problematic vintage, this wine opens with bold aromatic intensity, featuring notes of prune, plum, blackberry and spice. On the palate, the wine is structured and firm, with a touch of sweet cherry on the finish."
"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade."
"Made using fruit from one of the top Kamptal vineyards, this perfumed wine has great texture, with tight acidity and notes of green plum skin and lemon zest. With its depth of flavor and nervy, minerally edge, it will age for at least four years."
"A rich, full-bodied wine from one of the masters of Tannat, Pierre Laplace, this has ripe tannins and layers of toast, black plum and berry, with intense acidity on the finish."
"Made using fruit sourced from a parcel of vines more than 60 years old, this is a dense, dark wine, with herb, dark fig and plum notes. Solid and concentrated, it has a firm texture, and the dusty tannins match well with the ripe fruit. Age for 7â€“8 years."
"This is rich, spicy and full of red cherry flavor. It also has a dark, firm structure from the granite-based soil. The acidity that cuts through the fruit lends balance. Age this for 2â€“3 years."
"GÃª is one of Chile's perennial best blends. It mixes Syrah, CarmenÃ¨re and Cabernet Sauvignon into a lovable, complex whole. The nose is spicy yet suave, with cool berry, herb and olive aromas. It feels fresh, full and clean, with olive, pepper, cherry, cassis, coffee and chocolate flavors on the palate and finish. Only 452 cases made; drink nowâ€“2017."
"Made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc grown in the warm Happy Canyon region of the valley, this shows the greatness of the 2007 vintage. It's ready to drink, bearing soft, gentle tannins that frame flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, vanilla and sweet, smoky oak."
"Loaded with personality and special distinguishing qualities, this blend of Nocera, Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio is a wine for those interested in Italy's indigenous grapes. The bouquet is complex and layered with notes of bramble, forest berry, cassis, cola, dried ginger and green curry. The mouthful is tight, structured and streamlined."
"Made using fruit that was sourced from vines planted in 1939, this wine shows the great concentration low yields and old vines can give. It has Gamay's natural freshness, with firm, dry tannins, a spice note and a fragrant finish. It's drinkable now, but it will be better in two years."
"Creamy, smooth and rich, this gorgeous bottling offers flavors of lemon mousse, apricot and vanilla, backed by well-integrated acidity and fruity concentration."
"The mysteriously named Inchinnan offers a flavorful mix of mint, berry, cherry, milk chocolate, Asian spice, cedar and cola. It's harmonious, with subtle power and excellent length."
"Vintage Selection has long been the winery's age-worthy 100% Cabernet. Although this has an alcohol content that's higher than in the past, it should still reward cellaring. The wine is rich with a sweet blackberry flavor, with lots of new French oak. The tannins are hard, reminiscent of an older era of Napa Cabernet. Give it 5â€“6 years, but anything longer than that and the fruit may be threatened."
"Aromatic hints of new wood translate onto the smooth palate. It has smoke and black currant flavors, with tannins that are already well integrated. Attractive acidity gives this a final lift. Keep it for 5â€“6 years."
"A new-wood-dominated wine, this has a heavy toast character, with extracted licorice and dark chocolate flavors as well as a big black-plum note. Rich and weighty, with juicy acidity, this demands many years of aging."
"A powerful, wood-aged wine, this shows weighty black fruit and a toasty character. It is concentrated and solid, yet it has a soft and rich side as well.  The tarry, tannic character needs at least four years to soften."
"The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes. The palate is more racy and wiry than dense and soft, with juicy, flashy flavors of berry, cherry and currant. Those notes all carry through to the long finish; drink from 2013â€“2018."
"One of a pair of gorgeous Petit Manseng-based dessert wines by Claude Loustalot, this has richness but also lightness from the fresh acidity. This is fruity and fragrant, with a peach-like crispness, and it's worth keeping for another 3â€“4 years."
"Aromas of lead pencil, cassis, violet petal and smoky chocolate are complex and attractive. The palate of this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is tight, pure and rich, and the flavors of toasty black fruits carry accents of licorice and coffee. The finish is spicy, with a licorice note, and the wine's tannic composition suggests that aging is appropriate. Drink from 2014â€“2020."
"Rich and full, this has aromas of cherry, toasted nut, spice and chocolate. Its persistency would pair with roast pork stuffed with prunes."
"A huge step up from the previous vintage, this ripe, round and wonderfully fruity effort is a juicy, mineral-soaked bottle of joy. Luscious cherry fruit is topped with a dollop of butterscotch."
"There's a lot to like about this dense, deep, lush and totally ripe blend of 60% Petit Verdot plus smaller doses of Cabernet, CarmenÃ¨re, Malbec and MourvÃ¨dre. It glistens in the glass and shows plush aromatics and generous flavors of berry, plum, chocolate and spice. Toasty and smooth on the finish. Drink this excellent blend nowâ€“2018."
"A new addition to Steven Kent's lineup of exemplary Cabernets, this is 100% Cabernet from Ghielmetti Vineyard, one of Kent's favorite pieces of Livermore ground. The wine is concentrated and rich, with heady notes of dark cherry, cinnamon and clove, plus a trace of mint hiding in the background. This will please fans of California and Bordeaux wines."
"Aromas of acacia, mature apple, hazelnut and an unusual balsamic note lead the nose. The palate is already evolved and has lost most of its fruit richness and freshness, offering instead honeyed mineral, toasted nut and a hint of dried citrus peel."
There is an attractive spiciness to this clean warm wine. White currants and acidity add to the approachability of a wine that is ready to drink.
This is a really refreshing style of rosÃ©. Its fruity raspberry and red-currant flavors are shot through with fine acidity and a lively crisp aftertaste. Drink this attractive wine now.
"This solid, well-made wine has pleasant apple and pear flavors, light herbal accents, medium body and a smooth texture."
"This wine's melon and mango aromas come with an oily note of lanolin. It feels lazy on the palate, with just enough acidity to maintain freshness. Mild tropical fruit flavors turn yeasty on its hollow finish. Drink immediately."
"Cherry and blackberry aromas come with spice and cool note of cola in this Monatrell-Syrah blend. It's narrow and tannic, with black fruit and desert herb flavors that finish dry and rubbery."
"This wine's charred nose suggests over-the-top oak. The palate is a rough road of hard grape skin tannins. Char and clove flavors blanket its savory, meaty berry fruit, finishing woody and redolent of clove."
"This wine's light, sugary, red cherry and watermelon aromas lead to similar flavors and a light, lean texture. It has a bright coral color that's eye-catching."
"This wood aged Chenin Blanc has a strongly oxidative character. It has lost its fruit in favor of grilled almonds, toast and intense acidity. Drink this mature wine now."
"In the Boissonneau family since 1839, this southern Entre-Deux-Mers vineyard gives a crisp, herbal wine with light fruit and attractive acidity. It has lemon and grapefruit flavors, bright with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
"The Mottet family bought this chateau in 2009 and has been in renovation mode: chateau, winery, vast vineyards and placement of a dramatic 40-foot steel rooster in the vineyard. This wine is refreshing, lively and crisp, with plenty of acidity. It reveals spice, apples and lime flavors along with a more mineral side. The wine is ready to drink."
This wine has a touch of caramel as well as spice. Both work well with the red fruits that shine through this ripe wine. It is ready to drink.
"Light and fruity, this is a crisp wine with good acidity. a tangy character and a yeasty edge. Drink now."
Barrel toast and smoky gunpowder scents give this wine a savory edginess before revealing medium-bodied layers of baked blackberry and cherry.
"The tomato and plum aromas in this Garnacha blend are a bit soupy. Its chunky palate is heavy with generic berry fruit and a touch of oxidation. A solid, middle-of-the-road pour."
"This is a crisp, clean and refreshing wine. There is just the lightest sense of tannin giving the wine a zingy edge. Other than that, it is red-berry fruits all the way. Drink now."
"This is a delicious and ripe-fruited wine. Dominated by FernÃ£o Pires, it has an apple-puree texture: smooth and creamy. The wine has an edge of light acidity at the end to give it a lift. Drink now."
"This wine is light straw-colored, with aromas of lemon blossom, lemongrass and freshly cut lawn. Flavors of peach, passion fruit and melon finish with a touch of residual sweetness."
Delicate scents of spring blossom and citrus carry over to the bright simple palate along with sour cherry. Zesty acidity gives it tangy finish.
"This varietal Xarello feels more flat than vivid. It has fleshy yet generic white fruit aromas, ripe melon flavors and a tired finish."
"Melon, wood spice and vanilla aromas are common for this level of Chilean Chardonnay. A plump palate is low on acidity, while this tastes of pear, oak and skins-based bitterness. A woody tasting finish is adequate."
"This simple and fruity wine is made to be drunk young. And with its red fruits, light acidity and crisp texture, it succeeds. Drink the wine with summer barbecues."
"Wiry currant and plum aromas show a touch of oak in this value-priced wine. It feels somewhat chunky on the palate, with scraping tannins. Herbal plum flavors finish gamy and with a mild note of oaky clove."
"Briny saltwater aromas dominate a mild mostly fruitless nose. This feels basic and round, with a lemony streak. Mild nectarine flavors don't amount to much, while this is simple and generic on the finish."
"Subtly scented, this opens with aromas of citrus zest, spring flower and wild berry. It's fresh and informal, with light strawberry and sour-cherry flavors supported by fresh acidity."
"The blend of FernÃ£o Pires and Arinto is a classic for the region. It gives a light and perfumed wine with a creamy texture and plenty of balancing acidity. Bright and fruity, the wine has just a final tang to add crispness. Drink now."
"This is an open and ready-to-drink wine that has soft tannins and juicy blackberry fruit. With 50% Aragonez in the blend, it is has a smooth character that brings out plenty fruit and not too much structure. Drink now."
"Made with Nero di Troia grapes, this has aromas of wild rose, citrus peel and a whiff of Mediterranean brush. The bright informal palate offers sour cherry and strawberry accompanied by zesty acidity."
"Aged entirely in neutral French oak, this wine takes a light, simplistic approach in its presentation of golden honey apple and pear flavor."
This is a soft wine with its creamy fruits assimilated into the tangy texture. There is plenty of acidity to give this wine its cool character as well as its citrus and green-apple flavors. Drink now.
"The flagship wine from Quilceda Creek offers exotic scents of plum, cassis, loam, coffee and pine sap, a rich and evocative blend. The wine delivers all that is promised and more; it is deep and dense with flavor, polished, focused and persistent. Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits."
"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Nowâ€“2021."
"A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured."
"A beautiful wine, with the firmest tannins surrounded by perfumed fruit. It is dense, of course, but this density is balanced with great elegance, blackberry fruits, sweetness and final juicy acidity. The wine is structured, a powerhouse of concentration while preserving this complete style."
"A stunning Pirouetteâ€”63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day."
"Here's a â€œwowâ€ wine on every level, with incredible intensity and supple softness that builds momentum over many long minutes. A sweet cherry note at the core is surrounded by lush layers of tobacco, dark chocolate and spice, which promise to evolve gracefully over years to come."
"A very concentrated wine with such a stylish feel. It balances ripe berry fruits with chocolate and wood flavors in the richest, ripest combination. The wine has power, without losing its poised character. It's ready for long aging."
"Recently implemented winemaker and cellar changes make this one of the best Sassicaias ever. This Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers thick concentration and sun-kissed aromas of black fruit, prune, dried bay leaf, black olive and tobacco. The thick, fertile soils that characterize the magical strip of coastal Tuscany at Bol-gheri help shape amazing richness and intensity."
"The 2008 Ornellaia delivers concentrated aromas of forest fruit, raspberry and black cherry. There are beautiful elements of soft spice and chocolate at the back and the wine ends with soft, plush tannins and smooth, berry-rich flavors."
"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018."
"Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential."
"A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists. Show an elegant complexity and silky texture that define great California Pinot Noir, yet with a powerful impact that emphasizes raspberries, cherries and blueberries. Brilliant acidity and tannins provide the perfect framework on this wine that's drinkable now, and will develop over the next 15â€“20 years."
"A ripe year like 2009 is kind to the Cabernet Sauvignon of ChÃ¢teau Figeac. The wine is perfumed with new wood and sweet fruits, delicious black currant flavors giving both ripeness and freshness. The wine has weight and impressive density. A star of the vintage."
"An immensely structured wine, packed with dark tannins promising aging potential. It is complex, powerful, layered with new wood and concentration, finishing with dark plum fruits and acidity."
"Here's a beautifully chocolaty and rich blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with plush layers of sweet cherry, Indian spice, tobacco and espresso. The wine is amazingly rich and long lasting, with silky, supple tannins at the very end. Keep it in your cellar 10 years or more, or drink it now."
"Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year."
"Just across the road from PÃ©trus, la Fleur-PÃ©trus shares some of the same intensity. There is great fruit here, rounded and powerful with the ripest character. It is open, generous, ready to drink. The tannins lead into the purest acidity, letting the fruit sing."
"A dense, immense, solidly powerful wine. The ripest fruit overflows, paralleling the dark, solid tannins. As so often, Lynch-Bages is a blockbuster, dark and concentrated, with immense aging potential."
"A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years."
"The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated."
"Beneath the surface tannins is great Merlot fruit, very ripe and full-bodied, a powerhouse of flavors. The depth and complexity of the wine is all there, along with a dark core of dryness. A wine for long-term aging."
"A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer."
"Minty new wood aromas on a wine that shows both great tannins and sweet wood. The fruit is still to show, but promises fresh plum flavors that will be delicious and juicy. This is a ripe, concentrated wine."
"A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015."
"Very supple wine, with great richness and density. It is all so complete, a pleasure, powerful yet also with sweet opulent fruits layered with dark tannins. For long-term aging."
"Hugely dense, foursquare wine with great fruit and the purest tannins. Chocolate and coffee predominate at the same time as sweet tannins and acidity. A wine that combines charm with great power."
"One of the peculiarities of St.-Ã‰milion's classification is that Canon la GaffeliÃ¨re is not classed in the top rung. Because, as this wine shows, it produces superb wines. This is ripe while so elegant, with great intensity and sweet perfumes."
"Certainly the finest Grand Ciel Syrah to date, this is a full-flavored, complete wine, loaded with pure fruit flavors of berry and cassis. The details pile onâ€”a whiff of stone, a hint of chocolate, suggestions of spice, all in perfect proportion."
"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road."
"A blend of three vineyards, all estate, this is a sublime, viscous and somewhat briny wine that exhibits some oak on the nose. With a balance of weight and creaminess, it starts in ginger and nutmeg spiciness on the nose, building on the palate into fresh-cut apple and pear."
"Ripe, luscious black cherries and berries are framed by whispers of bramble and tannin in this enticingly fruity, forward Syrah. A showcase of fresh, primary fruit, it's juicy and delightfully gulp-worthy. Drink now through 2017."
"Waxy apple and lemon pith open this wine, followed by crisp, candied grapefruit. Robust, it finishes dry and balanced. The whole sums up into a full-bodied, rich and lush experience."
"Aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, dark spice and game come together in the glass. On the palate, notes of ground pepper and anise accent a core of dried black cherry while dusty tannins give it a firm finish. Drink soon."
"This wine enjoys the fruitiness of the vintage with its black-currant flavors and light tannic structure. The blend is 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc. The Cabernets, with ripe berry flavors that dominate here, give a firm core to the wine while not losing the potential of the fruit. Drink from 2017."
"Now managed organically, this estate has produced a light, fruity wine. Fresh red berries are sustained by a firm tannin edge that offers a solid base for the fruitiness and acidity. Drink from 2017."
"Gorgeous floral tones abound throughout this fruity, fresh, sparkling Riesling. It's a bit chewy and mouth-filling in foam, but pristine peach and apple flavors and spine-tingling acidity are enthralling."
"This fresh wine has attractive citrus and yellow fruit flavors and an orange tang. It needs more time; drink from 2017. The property includes five acres of white grapes and 65 acres of red. Sylviane Garcin-Cathiard also owns Clos L'Ã‰glise in Pomerol, ChÃ¢teau Barde-Haut in Saint-Ã‰milion and ChÃ¢teau Branon in Pessac-LÃ©ognan."
"Herbal and fruity at this young stage, this wine is bright with acidity, citrus fruits and a tangy texture. It is still young and almost too crisp for its own good, although it will likely develop into an attractively fruity, ripe wine with a fine weight of flavor. Drink from 2017."
"Bright and fruity, this is classic white Bordeaux with its citrus and lively acidity as well as a crisp texture. It has weight and shows some potential to fill out, so drink from 2017. Because of spring frost and summer rain, Marie-JosÃ© (Perrin) Leriche reduced the (90%) Sauvignon Blanc and (10%) SÃ©million harvest by a third."
This wine is dry but rich enough with black-currant flavors to compensate. The juicy aftertaste suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2017. This wine is the latest result of renovations on the 15-generation and 400-year-old Trocard family estate.
"This small 10-acre property has produced an attractively fruity wine with soft tannins and juicy black-fruit flavors. It is lightly structuredâ€”displaying more fruit than tanninâ€”and has a fresh, bright aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
"This second wine of ChÃ¢teau Potensac is soft, fruity with a hint of firmer structure. Juicy Cabernet gives the wine its shape and freshness. It is already drinkable, fruity and fresh."
"This wine is equal parts Syrah and Merlot (43% each), with the balance a smattering of other varieties. The coffee and berry aromas seem faint while the palate delivers all of the plush fruit flavors this vintage has to offer."
"This stylish Merlot-based wine has juicy red-berry flavors that are sustained by acidity and firmed up by tannins. Still dry from its dense structure, it's developing well. Drink from 2018."
"Smoothness, complexity and a great price are the strong points of this medium-bodied wine. It has wonderful raspberry, cedar and red-cherry flavors, light tannins, a polished feel on the palate and lingering finish."
"Pure butterscotch aromas seem to leap from the glass, yet the flavors are dry and rather reserved, not nearly as obvious as the smell. The balance leans toward tartness, the flavors are lean and the finish lemony."
"Perfumed aromas offer notes of white flowers, mineral and pink grapefruit. The flavors are dry and elegantly styled with a lingering finish. It will drink well at the dinner table."
"Made with Nero d'Avola and aged in wood, this unusual rosato opens with aromas that recall mature red fruit, cake spice, chopped sage, oak and a balsamic note. The smooth, round palate offers candied red cherry, tangerine zest, toasted almond and a note of candied ginger alongside bright acidity. It has a tutti frutti finish but the overall array of flavors gives it some depth."
"Vanilla, licorice, herb and woodspice aromas are followed by slightly gritty-feeling cranberry flavors. This wine is interesting, but it doesn't all come together."
"This medium-bodied wine is marked by dry, stony notes rather than a profusion of fruit. Subtle leafiness and hints of underripe melon give this a restrained aspect and suggest it's more of a food partner than a wine that will shine on its own."
Ripe peach and yellow cherry aromas take a turn towards the tropics on the palate of this intensely fruity wine. It's semi-dry in style with a slightly candied tone but balanced neatly by tart lemonÂ­-lime acidity. Drink now.
"This has value written all over it, offering fleshy, ripe tropical aromas and flavors. The personality is large and in charge, yet the wine itself remains reasonably balanced and firm in structure."
"Vanilla, coconut and toast aromas are vibrant and out-front, followed by tropical fruit. This wine is full bodied with a viscous, almost oily feel that persists through the finish. It offers some good things, but the variety gets lost in the style."
"Mature plum, aromatic herb and a whiff of cocoa lead the nose. The dense palate offers toasted oak, blackberry extract and espresso alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a firm, drying finish."
"The aromas of flowers and freshly cut pear, melon and starfruit are bright and fresh. This wine is dry and thick in feel with abundant citrus-rind flavors. There's enjoyment to be had but it gets bogged down in the middle."
"Under the same ownership as ChÃ¢teau de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness."
"This wine is still closed, lean and firm with its fruitiness masked by a strong mineral structure. It needs plenty of time to develop, so drink from 2018."
"Still lean and structured, this is a cool-feeling, young wine. It has dry tannins and a chewy texture that needs to soften. At the back, juicy black currant fruits show promise for the future. Drink from 2018."
"This is rich in spice, herbal characteristics and tangy acidity. It has a strongly mineral edge along with green fruits and tight lemon zest. Drink from 2017. AndrÃ© Lurton bought de Rochemorin in 1973; the estate has grown vines since the 16th century."
"This typical blend from southwest France draws on the intensely herbal character of both grapes. It's crisp, perfumed and refreshingly fruity, making it a great apÃ©ritif."
"Soft and fruity, this is an easy-to-drink wine. Its creamy texture and balanced acidity complement its apple flavors. It's ready to drink."
"A light, crisp blend of Merlot and Syrah, this is soft and gently fruity. Raspberry and red-currant flavors shine easily through this simple wine."
Tropical aromas of lychee and honeydew set up a straightforward palate. Powdery flavors of green melon and lychee are light and flowery on a modest finish.
"Crisp, bright and fruity, this is a refreshing and ripe wine. With attractive citrus acidity and a bright aftertaste, the wine is ready to drink."
"The very local Tamarez grapes make an appearance in this lemon-colored and flavored wine. It is fruity, soft and bright with acidity. Drink now."
"Aromas of dish soap and fruit salad show on the nose while the palate brings pink grapefruit and orange. A citric finish with a peppery note lacks acidity, so drink now."
"Flat aromas of lanolin and oily white fruits lead to a round, full palate that's getting tired. Salty nectarine and flowery flavors finish with a yeasty note of ham and white fruits."
"This is a light bright wine, full of forward fruitiness. The tangy edge of minerality gives the wine a pleasing texture. Citrus fruits support this texture with their zest and acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
"This light, cool-climate Pinot Noir is crisp with red currant fruit and herbal-tinged acidity. It has a zesty character that keeps it lively and tight. Drink now."
"Popping with aromas of lychee, rose, geranium and violet this wine is quite perfumed. There are also citrus notes of lime zest and lemon curd. Flavors are perfumed and soapy as well, and it wine coats your mouth. The finish is long with a slightly bitter end."
"Lightly spicy raspberry aromas are raw and peppery. This feels fleshy and pulpy, with punchy acidity. Peppery berry flavors are boosted by toasty oak that carries over to a mildly hot finish."
Intense yeasty aromas lean a bit nutty with a suggestion of citrus. Aggressively frothy bubbles give way to cashews and bread dough showing hints of lemon. Grapefruit pith and peanut skin bring a slightly bitter note to the finish.
"This is an easy, open wine that is lightly herbal. There is a barnyard edge that masks the fruit, although there is bright crisp acidity to give it a lift. Drink now."
"Named after the poppy that blooms in May in the Alentejo, this wine is juicy and fruity, with a light touch of tannins. It is all red berries, with an easygoing juicy character, Drink now."
"Young and fruity, this is a bright and wine for immediate drinking. It has hints of tannins, plenty of red fruits and no wood."
"Powerful aromas of lychee, mango and peach give a vibrant feel tropical to this wine. These aromas show the palate and are joined by peach candies and rosewater. With decent acidity, this still feels viscous on the palate and has a medium finish that ends with ginger spice."
"The sunshine of the Languedoc comes through in this wine's warm, soft fruit. A touch of acidity and a backdrop of tannins give it contrast and a fine, ready-to-drink character."
"Structured and with solid tannins, this is a wood- and spice-laden wine. Its fruit lies somewhere behind all this structure and is likely to remain there."
"This youthful pink-colored number smells of dusty cherry and Lifesavers. A juicy palate has a soda-like feel, while flavors of raspberry and cherry are light and dilute across the finish."
A bit of charred wood and black pepper in the aroma give way to lush berry and cherry flavors that spread across the palate and cling to the sides of the mouth. This wine is lightly oaky and has an attractive richness that lasts on the finish.
"Tightly constructed for an entry-priced Chardonnay, this has faint almond nuttiness accenting pineapple and grapefruit flavors. Drink this medium-bodied wine through mid-2018."
"Full and ripe, this wine offers thick meaty flavors of pineapple and peach, finishing in sweet vanilla oak."
This is a crisp cherry-flavored wine. Cool-climate Pinot Noir has a light texture that gives the wine a hint of tannins although it is much more about fruit and bright acidity. Drink now.
"There are firm and dusty tannins in this spicy wine. It has firm fruit, a solid texture and a juicy, nutmeg-flavored aftertaste. Drink from 2018 when some of the tannins have softened."
"Tinta MiÃºda, known as the rare Graciano grape in Spain, is not often found in Portugal. Here it makes a ripe, juicy and jammy wine that's soft, with only a minimum of tannins to keep it together. It has a typically warm character and is ready to drink."
Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.
"This offers earthy aromas of game, tilled soil, leather and forest floor. The lean rustic palate offers suggestions of dried cherry, a hint of dark spice and a gamy note alongside firm acidity and dusty tannins."
"A light earthy, toasted aroma and mostly savory rather than outright fruity flavors mark this medium-bodied, dry wine. The texture is smooth and rich enough to complete a good picture."
"With ripe, generic fruit flavors, a soft texture and slight sweetness, this is a very easygoing, easy-drinking, light-bodied wine."
"Cherry cough drop and minerally, almost chlorine aromas lead to an edgy high-acid hard palate. This blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Syrah tastes medicinal and like creamy but fiery red plum. A screechy-feeling, chocolaty-tasting finish leaves an impression."
"Lime and tangerine aromas are light and dusty, with a yeasty note. This feels mostly sound but basic, with leesy, melony flavors. On the finish, this loses intensity and turns bready in flavor and soft in feel."
"This plummy, dusty red wine is simple and straightforward in its approach to tannin and oak. Offered at a fair price it should please a wide range of palates."
"Reedy green-leaning aromas of plum and raspberry feed into a creamy palate. This tastes primarily of herbal red-berry fruits that finish oaky, dry and spicy."
"This shows some pungent, boxwood-like scents up front, followed by modest passion fruit and a bit of citrus, falling away on the finish. Drink now."
"Lisboa, with its cool climate, lends itself to crisp rosÃ©s like this. This lively fruity wine is touched by hints of vanilla and layers of red-fruit flavors. It is light and ready to drink."
"Dry earthy herbal aromas of tomato, red-berry fruits and oak set up a full palate with pounding tannins. This tastes roasted and herbal, with notes of bell pepper, tomato and creamy oak. A hard-tannin finish confirms that this Merlot skipped charm school."
"This is a neutral, papery white wine, with a flat, rather than lively mouthfeel. The apple flavored fruit is there, along with a touch of licorice, but the freshness seems to have been lost along the way."
"Mula Velha, â€œthe old donkey,â€ is a younger wine than its name suggests. Brisk and fruity, it offers firm tannins and layers of blackberry fruit. With a touch of oak aging, the wine is developing well and will be ready to drink from late 2017."
"This wine is ripe, full of black fruits and soft tannins. With plenty of acidity to keep it crisp, the wine has a cool, flavorful character topped off by berry fruits. It's ready to drink."
"This wine is light in tannins and ripe in fruit, with a delicious red-berry character. Drink this attractive wine from 2019."
"This is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins and attractive red-berry fruits. There is just a touch of dryness that gives this easygoing wine its structure. Drink from early 2017."
"High-toast aromas are followed on the palate by flavors that are more about wood than fruit. That gives the wine a tough, extracted character that probably will not go away."
"This is a crisp and fruity wine that's perfumed and full of citrus and green fruits. It has a lively character that is filled out with the ripe fruitiness of the vintage. The aftertaste, bright and fresh, suggests it will benefit from another few months. Drink from summer 2016."
"Roughly equal portions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot go into this tannic blend. It may be a little too far along the aging curve, at least for showing much fruit. It's drying outâ€”displaying a touch of leatherâ€”and should be consumed as soon as possible."
"The Claret benefits from an additional year of bottle age, integrating the components (60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% each Cab Franc and Malbec). Tart red-berry fruit is accented with light toast from barrel aging. There's a slight hint of burnt rubber that will blow off with decanting."
"This is a light simple red, without particular varietal character. It's much like an inexpensive California Merlotâ€”fine for every day drinking, generic and unassuming."
"This inky-colored zesty wine offers aromas of sour cherry, leather and a hint of dried herb. The extremely simple, easygoing palate shows red plum and a hint of clove alongside loose knit tannins."
"This wine is smooth and soft, with an attractive creamy texture and light acidity. Yellow fruits and stewed pears are lifted by a mineral texture. The wine is named after the vineyard rather than after the literal Portuguese meaning of â€œscantily dressed.â€ Drink now."
"Light cinnamon and sugar aromas, and fresh, fruity and lightly sweet flavors make this wine easy on the palate. The texture is soft."
Oily aromas of citrus peel and lychee set up a lemony palate with pyrazine-influenced citrus flavors. Lychee is the lead flavor on a finish that's mildly bitter.
"Wet stone and graphite scents up front give way to hints of honey and Earl Grey tea (bergamot). It's medium bodied and fades quickly on the finish, but it's a solid buy for under $10."
"This good, basic wine offers herb and cherry aromas, mostly crisp fruit flavors and a firm, tannic texture."
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, plum and blue flower come together on this. The simple palate offers morello cherry and a hint of clove alongside soft, not very persistent tannins."
This is a light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. It has spice and a layer of dry tannins that are acting as a support to the red fruits and acidity.
This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.
"This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish."
"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony."
"A huge, ripe, opulent wine, rich in orange, butter, peach, honey and spice flavors. Shows great depth and power, yet finishes thoroughly dry and crisp. Should develop bottle complexities over the next six years. Blended with 15% Roussanne."
"Not a big, overwhelming blockbuster, this harmonious blend of equal parts Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Clairette and Bourboulenc features ripe citrus and pineapple flavors, with a hint of melon thrown in for good measure. It's pleasantly medium bodied and creamy in the mouth, with a reasonably long finish. Drink it over the next 12â€“18 months."
"Like many of the '07 Hermitages, this isn't a huge wine, but instead shows a nice sense of proportion, marrying hickory smoke with touches of cracked peppercorns, cedar and roasted beef. Drink nowâ€“2020."
"Libatio shows nice integration with smooth tones of cassis, blueberry, white almond and dried spice. The results deliver balance and elegance and make this a food-friendly option for meat or hearty pasta dishes."
"Flamboyantly rich in cherries, raspberries and cranberries that are a bit tart, yet enriched with sweet oak. Firm acidity brings everything to a clean, bright finish. A pretty wine, showing elegance and finesse."
"Gavin Chanin makes this distinctive, interesting Chardonnay. Shows a ino Sherry-like yeastiness, and is minerally and streamlined. Zesty flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits round out the finish."
"Another Livermore Valley producer to watch, Cuda Ridge has fashioned a varietally textbook Cab Franc here, with an intensely woody, herbal nose. Medium-bodied, with tannins that are integrated and ready to soften, this Cab Franc, barrel-aged for 18 months, is really, really good, and ready to age another 3â€“5 years."
"Opens with rooty, baked aromas before finding its legs and plenty of ripe, attractive berry fruit. The palate is juicy and solid, with good acidity and nice flavors of wild berry, chocolate and toast. Stylish and very solid. Definitely a food-friendly Malbec."
"Bordeaux grapes mix with Zweigelt in this full-bodied, serious wine. It has initial severe tannins, followed by ripe currant and blackberry fruit. The wood aging gives good spice character. Well worth aging for 3â€“4 years."
"Il Veltro is a newish brand of Brunello from Montalcino that opens with bright berry nuances and background notes of spice, cola, tobacco and leather. The mouthfeel is rich and firm, enduring but not too heavy or overdone."
"Fruit-driven, with pear and apple, but an interesting streak of licorice running down the spine of the wine. It has depth and good structure, so the now-dominant young fruit will have support as it ages. Worth sitting on for a couple more years."
"Complex, mineral wine, crisp but also very, very textured. Flavors of peach and red apples work with pink grapefruit to give the fruit character, while there is also a more serious complexity of green herbs. The finish is soft, still mineral. Screwcap."
"Rosemary-marinated steak, roast pork roll stuffed with prunes or dark chicken or turkey meat would make perfect paring partners to this red blend from southern Tuscany. Aromas of spice, mature cherry and leather are soft and penetrating."
"Fragrant with a mix of sweet grass and dusty blossom, this pleasant Sauvignon Blanc makes you wonder why the grape is so rare in Oregon. Here in the Umpqua Valley it finds a sweet spot, fresh and varietal, round and tart, with the added complexity of the flowery aromatics."
"Sweet pipe tobacco and red cherry open the nose of this plush Syrah from Maremma, Tuscany. Soft, chewy tannins make this inky red wine appropriate to pair with grilled porcini mushrooms or veal in cream sauce."
"As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability."
"Lots of tannins and acidity on this dry Grenache, but it's so rich and sweet in cherries, you can drink it now. Somehow manages to be fun and serious at the same time. A real success for this finicky variety in California."
"An unusual blend of Viognier and Chardonnay, the wine is brilliantly dry and crisp. It's rich and spicy in citrus, tropical fruit and spice flavors, brightened with bracing acidity. Opulent, yet crisp and refreshing."
"Rich and broad in the mouth, with notes of honeyed citrus reminiscent of tangerine and a tang of peppery spice. The finish is warm, spicy and long, with a hint of vanilla oak. Drink it now and over the next year or two for its undeniable richness."
"Rich and opulent, showing masses of honeydew melon, orange crÃ¨me, vanilla and spicy flavors. Really seductive, so easy to like. A touch of oak adds just the right note of smoke. Great with roast pork."
"With fruit picked on January 7, 2009, this superrich wine shines with acidity that picks out the fuller honey flavors. It has an almost unctuous texture, very smooth, with orange zest and peach giving a fresh side to the wine."
"In a word, wow. What a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon. It has got to be one of the best buys out there, so rich and smooth in berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Only 640 cases were produced, but worth a search. Drink now."
"Solid and smooth from the beginning, with cola, pastry and blackberry aromas. The palate is fresh, full and healthy, with cola, black pepper and a ton of berry push. Toasty and roasted on the finish, where coffee comes into play. Right on the spot for value-priced Malbec."
"The fruit appears very ripe, almost too ripe, making the wine difficult to pair with food because of the width and intensity of its jammy nose. Yet more harmonious tones of chocolate, coffee and spice kick in at the rear to add dimension."
"While oak can commonly overwhelm Chardonnay, this is a perfect example of an appropriate balance. Toasted notes of almond and peach pit intertwine with red apple and underripe pear; crisp acidity shines through on the finish."
"As much as Tuscany and Syrah seem to be a match made in heaven, this wine is lower in overall intensity and rather neutral in aromas. Pretty cherry-berry and fine wood nuances are measured and understated. Firm structure and tannins, with a tart cherry note on the close."
"Amarone producer Tommasi has produced this approachable blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet. The aromas are simple but direct, including cherry, spice and vanilla."
"Rounded but also fruity, this soft wine is perfumed, hinting at white flowers and tropical fruits. While the acidity is low, the fruit is easy, ripe and lightly structured."
"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors. Roundness and a smooth feel work in the wine's favor, because there's just enough acidity to push the length on the finish. Drink right away."
"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry. Shows a complexity you don't usually find at this price."
"Pronounced minerality and fresh, bright fruit are balanced nicely in this stylish wine. A touch of spice adds dimension. Pair with poultry dishes."
"The 18 months of aging in 90% American oak really shows in the forward flavors and aromas of vanilla and mocha. Some black fruit shines through on the palate in the form of cassis and black cherry. Balanced and round, though generally light weight."
"A ripe, thickly extracted Sangiovese that offers loads of blueberry fruit and cookie dough aromas. It's surprisingly thick and creamy in the mouth with toasted nut flavors on the close."
"This medium-bodied Chardonnay features ample apple, pear and pineapple fruit that comes across as pleasant and mouthfilling, if also a bit one-dimensional. Still, it represents a reasonable value."
"This is a straightforward, plump, fruity Chardonnay. Round peach and lemon flavors get a burst of energy from hints of pineapple and citrus, finishing clean and fresh. Drink now."
"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day."
"The packaging is totally crazy but the wine is more subdued. A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet, it delivers raw strawberry, green leaf notes and loads of dried hay. It has a sharp, solid build and rigid tannins."
"This Central Coast vineyard has produced an extraordinarily rich, vibrant Viognier, brimming with tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and vanilla-spice flavors. It benefits from crisp acidity, and finishes clean and off-dry."
"While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors. It has a medium-weight body and almost a honeyed roundness. Drink now."
"Seems almost sweet, with cherry and chocolate flavors that dominate the palate. Drink now."
"This Sangiovese from a hot vintage definitely seems past its peak. It has a very sweet-smelling, cherry-driven nose with a touch of marmalade that is blasted by a sudden rush of oak wood."
"A firm wine, with dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The fruit flavors are  dark fig and stewed plums; there is a bitter edge to the tannins."
"Raspberry and cherry mingle with essence of mocha, tomato and pepper. Solid structure, full flavors and smooth tannins create a clean yet gripping texture, finishing strong and lengthy."
"Here's a likeable Chard, with peach, pear and fig flavors that have a distinctly herbal edge, like dried sage. Turns buttery and vanilla-y on the finish."
"A soft, lightly sweet style of rosÃ©, flavored with strawberries and a touch of caramel. Fresh, and flavorful, with balancing acidity, this is a good apÃ©ritif wine."
"This wine is a â€œproductâ€ in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and GewÃ¼rz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness."
"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness. It's easy to like, a nice late afternoon cocktail sipper, and good with baked ham or pot stickers."
"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors."
"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well."
"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best."
"Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish."
"The earthy spice character of this masculine but poised Pinot makes it a unique and stylish pick for red wine lovers. Flavors are balanced, the acids are in check and the finish is delicate but spicy. Overall, a nice wine with class."
"Layers of round, appealing Chardonnay aromas lead into this nicely balanced offering from New York. Earthy spice and good acidity give the wine both complexity and elegance, and the finish is lengthy. A good wine for solo sips or pairing with poultry and fish."
"For classic Rioja, Monte Real is always a good bet. This offering delivers textbook aromas of dried raspberry and cherry offset by fallen leaves and a pinch of seashell. The palate is still quite fresh, while black cherry, raisin, spice and cocoa flavors finish smooth and long, with a touch of oxidation and a Sherry note for added complexity. Drink through 2022."
"Laced with acidity, this is a complex, structured wine with great freshness as well as a dry core of botrytis. It has a rich potential, closed at the moment but holding dense texture and balance between lemon and honey. Drink from 2019."
"Coming from an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this cool-climate study offers aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, Eastern European goulash spices and crushed peppercorns of all colors. It's fresh and lively on the palate, with hints of rose and tart raspberry. At the same time, it's quite vegetal, with green notes that will evolve into more balanced umami flavors from 2017 to 2022."
"From a vineyard 1,700 feet above the small town of Corralitos comes this tasty wine that begins with aromas of smoked apple, lemon zest, honeysuckle and sea salt, as well as a struck-match element. The palate shows flavors of fresh apple, chamomile and a dusting of crushed vanilla, all set against a chalky grip."
"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees. Full bodied, rich and layered with a creamy feel, it's appealing now but should have a long life ahead."
"This blend of Syrah, MourvÃ¨dre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit."
"Classic Sangiovese aromas of underbrush, pressed powder, violet and wild berry mingle in the glass. The vibrant palate offers layers of black cherry, dried red cherry, white pepper, truffle and savory herb alongside firm but refined tannins and bright acidity. This is all about polish and finesse. Drink 2018â€“2028."
"Rounded and rich, this generous, full-bodied wine comes from a single parcel in the heart of Saint-Ã‰milion. Black fruits are structured with dense tannins and a firm tension between ripeness and dryness. The wine is powerful, finishing with pepper and spice. Drink from 2018."
"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish."
"This blend of Les Collines (60%), Lewis (20%) and Portteus (20%) vineyards, which saw 25% new French oak, offers blueberry and huckleberry along with herb and dark chocolate accents. It's supple and soft in feel, deft but with depth to the fruit flavors."
"This opens with an enticing fragrance of rose, violet, dark berry and underbrush. The firm palate delivers juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and star anise alongside firm but fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018â€“2028."
"Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time."
"Aromas of tilled earth, leafy forest floor, porcini mushroom, truffle and ripe berry lead the nose. The palate offers wild cherry layered with medicinal herb, black pepper and grilled sage supported by firm tannins. It's still young and a bit disjointed so give it time to come together. Drink after 2018."
"The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine. Pepper, boysenberry and game consume the nose, with blackberry fruit, mint, tobacco and a greenish bitterness keeping the palate interesting."
"This full-bodied red manages to be concentrated and weightless at the same time. It opens with aromas of blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of espresso. The smooth, almost creamy palate delivers a black cherry core while notes of graphite, clove, ground pepper and cake spice add depth. It's impeccably balanced, with velvety tannins and just the right amount of freshness. Drink through 2017."
"This is an extremely rare beastâ€”a single-vineyard, single-varietal (Pinot Noir), single-vintage sparkling wine. Aged sur lie for 42 months, it draws you into the glass with notes of smoke, raspberry, mineral and nutty spices. The flavors are light and lively with tart, racy acidity and a long, lingering finish."
"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate."
"Aromas of menthol, dried flower, ripe berry, leather and savory herb lead the nose. The rich palate delivers crushed wild cherry, stewed plum, cinnamon, anise and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Despite its big, friendly structure, it also boasts finesse. Drink through 2022."
"Meaty and spicy, this wine is in an early stage of development. It has dark tannins that have an extracted, tough character. However, the weight of ripe fruit is all there, promising a rich and concentrated wine for the future. Drink from 2020."
"New-wood spice dominates the aroma of this wine, given weight by the rich black plum fruits and concentrated acidity. With its big structure and equally big fruits, this is an impressive wine for long aging. Drink from 2022."
"This wine has yeasty aromas and a light character that brings out springy acidity before the dry botrytis. It is still forming itself around the dry core, waiting to become generous and rich. Drink from 2019."
"One of the few great values from Pauillac, this 10-acre estate has produced an attractive perfumed wine that expresses both ripe black fruit and great structure. It's not a wine for long aging with its already-fragrant acidity. It has sweet tannins, delicious fruitiness and a lengthy aftertaste. Drink from 2019."
"As is often the case with PhÃ©lan SÃ©gur, there is an excess of wood in this wine. Sometimes it works, as here, because the big, bold fruits are powerful enough to match the toastiness. That suggests a future as a ripe, black-fruited and structured wine with room for juicy acidity. Drink from 2019."
"This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style."
"Forward red fruits give a good beginning to this light and fruity blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is crisp with red currant flavors and layers of acidity. Drink now."
"Briny lemon-lime aromas are simplistic. This blend of Moscatel and Merseguera is foamy, while good acidity keeps it on a level plane. Ripe, sweet flavors of lychee, honeydew and mango are pure Moscato, while acidity from the Mersequera helps this along."
"This is a straightforward quaffer. Aromas of herbs, jasmine and stone fruit lead to sugary-sweet fruit flavors."
"From the beginning, this crianza from a very good vintage is lacking. The nose is mulchy and cheesy, with almost no fruit character. The palate is edgy in feel, while leafy, stalky red-fruit flavors are salty and taste of vanilla and caramel."
Jammy fruits conflict with a firm tannic structure. This wine is not yet balanced and needs a lighter touch. Producer is Jean Paul Barre.
"Aromas of rhubarb, herbs and strawberry mark the nose. This feels solid and mostly fresh, while flavors of pickled rhubarb and briny plum come with sugary sweetness in front of a salty finish."
"This wine is a field blend of Syrah, MourvÃ¨dre and Grenache from Bishop's vineyard. Aromas of herbs, berry, cumin and wet copper penny are followed by smooth-feeling dark berry flavors with a tart, mesquite-filled finish."
"Lemon and spice make this a fruity while textured wine. It tastes like the chalk soil from which it comes, very mineral and flinty. This wine is all fruit now and will broaden out from 2016."
"This is just recognizably Pinot Noir, full of tannins with a tight edge. Bitter cherry flavors and very fresh acidity give a mineral flavor that is only just showing juiciness. Drink from 2016."
"Charred, blackened aromas of mint, licorice and burnt tire overshadow the wine's black-fruit components. This feels thick and dense, with chewy weight. Medicinal, herbal flavors of black fruits are peppery and a bit green, while mint and cough drop notes control the finish of this 85% Garnacha Tintorera and 15% Monastrell blend."
"While this wine has a strong tannic structure, it also offers plenty of ripe fruit. Acidity is kept in its place, giving freshness allied to warm berries. Drink this attractive wine from 2016."
"Apple and pear notes have a slightly savory tone in this brisk, lemony dry Riesling. Throughout a tasting of two samples, there are lingering tones of rubber and struck matches that blow off gradually with aeration."
"This juicy red wine offers thick layers of black pepper and blueberry around sturdy oak. However, its opulent beginnings start to thin on the midpalate, veering into sour flavors and a touch of heat."
"Sweet green apple, lemon and lime notes meld in this off-dry Riesling, somewhat evocative of green Jolly Rancher's candy. Whiffs of smoke and nuts add a savory dimension to this brisk, easy drinking wine. Drink now."
"Pickled, briny aromas of citrus and berry fruits are modest. On the palate, this is soft and low on acidity. Flavors of raspberry, cherry and red currant are mild, with a touch of bitterness."
"This crisp, fruity wine is fresh with citrus, grapefruit and an attractive zesty texture. Aromatic and bright, it is ready to drink now, clean and fragrant."
"All Merlot, this pale-pink wine offers aromas of herbs, grass and cherry. Though the label suggests otherwise, it drinks off dry, with pit-fruit flavors."
"Too much extraction has given this wine a dry character. It does have juicy red fruits underneath and these should come out as the wine ages. It is likely, though, always to be a dry wine."
"This firm, smoky wine with fine tannins and ripe fruit is developing well, allowing the berry fruits to come through the structure. Give this wine until late 2016."
"Flat boysenberry and plum aromas are jammy and a bit floral. This feels clipped and rugged, with reedy plum and raspberry flavors that finish short."
"From owner Jean-Pierre Palatin's vineyards at the highest elevation in this appellation, this mostly Merlot wine is soft and fruity, ripe but with little sense of structure. It is juicy and with some acidity. Light and perfumed, it is ready to drink. The winemaker is Thomas Guibert who also handles Ferrand, Palatin's Saint-Ã‰milion grand cru."
"A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture. The flavors are more like blackberries and blueberries, but the overall effect is slightly viscous."
"Soft, ripe and fruity, this spicy wine has attractive acidity. It offers a light texture, pepper and a bite of orange zest at the end."
"Herbal berry aromas include a heavy dose of spent coffee grinds and oak. This has an edgy, hard mouthfeel and oaky flavors of plastic and vanilla that sit on top of herbal berry notes. A creamy finish maintains the wine's oaky theme."
"Dark, dry and puckering with a stewed plum aroma and flavor, this wine offers a depth of tannin and herbal notes. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, it spent 20 months in French oak."
"Ripe and jammy with attractive soft fruits and acidity, this wine has crushed strawberry and light spice flavors. Drink from late 2016. MACIF, a mutual insurance company, bought the estate in the 1980s and restored the vineyards and beautiful chÃ¢teau. The estate manager is FredÃ©ric Dubois and consultant is Georges Pauli."
"This wine is concentrated, with fruit that seems too ripe. Jammy berry flavors are mixed in with dry tannins and a firm backdrop. It's solid, although not quite balanced. The estate was founded in 1967 by Philippe Raguenot; daughters Emmanuelle and Marie-Pierre took over in 1997."
"While there are firm tannins, this wine also has plenty of fresh black currant fruits. Acidity and a crisp texture give it a lift and brightness. Drink this 100% Merlot from 2016 when the tannins have softened."
"Perfumed strawberry aromas show well. On the palate, this wine is fruity, jammy in texture with good balancing acidity. The tannins still need to soften, so drink from 2017."
"Firm but with juicy fruit, this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is a solid, still young, wine. The aftertaste is tough and packed with acidity."
"This Southern RhÃ´ne-style blend is roughly half MourvÃ¨dre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the MourvÃ¨dre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206â€“2022."
"Classically crafted, it opens with a fruit-driven fragrance of bright red berries accented with whiffs of cooking spices and balsamic herbs. The juicy palate delivers fleshy black cherry, black raspberry, black pepper and exotic spices alongside big, velvety tannins. Soft and delicious, this is already accessible so enjoy over the next few years."
"Jammy, ripe blueberry and blackberry aromas belie a crisp, tight palate, with wild berry, licorice and peppery flavors. This is fresh, wiry, firmly structured and alert as well as comfortable and controlled. Think classic Priorat to drink through 2018."
"Hugely tannic, this formidable wine has great weight, richness and a dark and dense structure. Juicy berry fruits, sweet plum flavors and a dry, concentrated backdrop promise aging. Drink from 2018."
"Perfumed, ripe and packed with blackberry fruits, this wine displays a great sense of elegance. It is fresh while the solid structure provides a contrast of tannins. The end shows acidity and fruitiness."
"A strong Merlot element has produced a ripe, juicy wine, full of fruit balanced with a subtle use of wood. It's a powerful, concentrated wine that has impressive tannins, rich berry fruits and acidity. Drink from 2018."
"This is a Ã¼ber aromatic wine with a long list of notes that include orange marmalade, peach, citrus, and drizzled honey. Harvested at 42 brix and retaining a whopping 240 g/L residual sugar, it's supremely rich and sweet with a lingering finish."
"The vineyard is famous for producing ripe, luscious Pinots stuffed with massive fruit. Many wineries have dipped into it over the years. Krutz's rendition is dry, balanced and full-bodied, with relatively high alcohol framing raspberry, cherry, cola, red plum, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors. It should age well through 2020â€“2022."
"The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors. The balanced 2012 vintage has given it tremendously ripe cherry, raspberry, red currant and cola flavors, yet the wine retains an exciting sense of control and balance. Give it until 2018â€“2019 in the cellar to gain traction."
"It's risky to suggest aging a California Chardonnay, but you'd do well to stash this away until sometime in 2015. Right now, the wine is all about brisk acidity, oak and fresh, ripe tropical fruit, orange and pear flavors. All those parts need time to come together."
"Floral hints, latex, vanilla, oak and ripe berry aromas all show up on a fine bouquet. Ripe and creamy in feel, it holds dark, hard-pushing flavors of licorice, anise, coffee and blackberry. There's agility, elegance and complexity to this Malbec. Drink through 2017."
"A rich barrel selection, this is a fine Pinot Noir that's silky, brisk in acidity, dry and deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper cola. Give it at least until 2018 in the cellar."
"Half was whole-cluster fermented, yielding dense scents and flavors with black olive, herb and a touch of mocha. Cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are smooth and detailed, and the tannins firm and polished."
"This earthy wine opens with aromas of meat juices, baking spices and black fruit together with notes of leather and balsam. The rich palate delivers dark red cherry layered with mint and a tad of milk chocolate alongside dusty tannins. It' well balanced and should age moderately well. Drink 2016â€“2024."
"A beautiful wine to pair with desserts based on white fruits or simple but delicious vanilla sponge cake. Made from late-harvested Chardonnay, it's very sweet in apricots, lemons, vanilla and buttered toast, with a brisk edge of acidity for balance."
"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, sautÃ©ed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018."
"This is pure MourvÃ¨dre from three excellent Red Mountain sites: Heart of the Hill, Ciel du Cheval and Grand RÃªve vineyards. Tart, stony raspberry fruit carries a hint of cured meat and straw. The wine displays excellent length and a delicious purity."
"Andrea Cortonese makes ripe, structured Brunellos and this is an impressive effort from the variable 2008 vintage. It opens with aromas reminiscent of black plum, chocolate, vanilla and leather. These carry over to the palate along with toasted notes, spice and espresso. The fruit is supported by assertive tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2015â€“2023."
"From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024."
"Smooth and rich while remaining structured, this wine performs the role of second wine very well. The tannins are already rounded and the black currant fruit remains fresh. It should be ready to drink in 2016."
"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017."
"The local grape CastelÃ£o is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon in this soft, spicy and fruity wine. Red fruits and balanced acidity are given a shove by a lightly tannic structure. The wine is ready to drink."
"It seems perverse to plant GewÃ¼rztraminer in the Douro and this wine is as much a curiosity as it is attractively perfumed. Showing all the hallmarks of the grape, the palate carries flavors of lychee and rosewater, although it all seems muted. The acidity does give a final lift."
"This light, fresh Chardonnay has lively pear and apple flavors. A crisp texture gives zing to the brightly fruity wine. Drink now."
"This wine is light, fruity and with only a slightly tannic character. Aromatic cherry flavors give freshness and bring out a jammy character. It's ready to drink."
"Coming in a sparkly package befitting its name, this boxed wine shows honeysuckle and pineapple on the nose. On the palate, green apple flesh and pink apple skins prove tart and ripe at the same time, though without tons of body or finish. It's a solid deal though!"
"Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs. This Cava's moderate, straightforward personality is due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello."
"Lanson suggests adding fruit to this wine or using it as the base for cocktails. It is off dry, ripe and fruity in itself. A touch of toast suggests this bottling is not young. The wine confuses between crisp acidity and a soft, neutral texture. It will probably be best when it is part of a mixed drink."
"Lots of stone fruit ripeness marks the nose of this wine, with aomas of nectarine and peach cut by the sharpness of apple skins. The palate is all green apples and lime juice."
"Staunch aromas of leather and animal hide ride heavily on top of rubbery blackberry scents. This feels solid but scattered, with cherry and cassis flavors that come across jammy. Rubbery notes and a mild cheesy oak character dominate the finish."
"Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon. A round finish, much like the nose, shows a fleshy component."
"Savory aromas and flavors combine with a soft texture in this full-bodied wine. It smells smoky and roasted, tastes like pomegranate and cherry juice and has a streak of acidity but not much tannin."
"A blend of Arinto and Tamarez, this wine is light and fruity, with attractive acidity and flavors of apricots sprayed with lemons. It has a light texture and a fresh, lively aftertaste. Drink now."
"While more herbal in character, this wine also carries grapefruit, lemon and quince flavors. It is fresh with a steely mineral character that adds some interest. Drink now."
"This blend of Merseguera and Sauvignon Blanc is modest as a church mouse, with clean but dilute green-apple aromas. An easygoing, round palate offers orange and lime flavors in front of a pithy, citrusy finish."
"Damp, foresty, stalky aromas are backed by a chunky, slightly sticky feeling palate. Black cherry and mocha flavors set the stage for a ripe finish, with brown-sugar sweetness."
"Leesy vanilla aromas are scattershot and include bready notes of baked apple and pear. This feels round, plump and low on acidity. Flavors of grassy, green citrus and tropical fruits turn bitter before flattening out on a mild finish."
"This is an earthy, rustic wine tasting of black cherry, cola and a mention of sage, medium bodied on the palate and softly textured. It will please a range of palates, showing varietal character with vigor."
"This wine is tight, fresh with crisp red currant and red-cherry flavors. It is as bright as a button, fruity with layers of acidity that bring out a perfumed character at the end. The Colonge family has been growing grapes in Beaujolais since 1789."
"Fresh and fruity, this is a ripe, cherry-flavored wine (hence the name Griottes, a type of cherry). It is light with a straight line of acidity that cuts through the attractive fruitiness. Drink immediately."
"Banana aromas don't intrude too strongly into the fruity palate of this wine that has a crisp character. Tart red-berry fruits and and bright acidity give the wine a fresh, totally fruity appeal with only a hint of tannin. Drink now."
"Grassy, green aromas give this a herbal, crisp taste. It is tight and tangy, with green fruit aromas and a fresh aftertaste. Drink now."
"Salmon-colored and spritzy, this rosÃ© of Pinot Grigio smells stony and peachy. A zesty palate has sizzle and zest to it, while stone-fruit and minerally flavors are salty prior to a mildly bitter finish that tastes of pithy citrus."
"Structured and firm, this wine has more in the way of dry tannins than of fruit. It presents a fine skeleton without much flesh, leaving a wine that is tight and extracted. It needs plenty of time, so drink from late 2016."
"This structured wine has a tight, tannic, dry character. It is slow to develop, leaving the black cherry fruits still masked by the forward dryness. Drink from 2016."
"Forest berries, perfumed violets and pine needles entertain the nose on this widely available bottling. The palate shows dried herbs, tar and smashed blackberries."
"This wine is totally fresh, with crisp red currant and riper banana flavorsâ€”a bright wine that's all fruit and refreshing acidity. The family has been in the wine business since 1811 and today works with some 50 small-production growers."
"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of MencÃ­a and other grapes."
"Oaky, jammy aromas are wayward and slightly green. This blend of Tempranillo and Monastrell delivers heavy tannins on a widespread but unfocused palate. Oaky, drying berry flavors are more bitter than fruity, while the finish is choppy in feel and woody in taste."
This wine offers appealing aromatics of caramel apple before delving into viscous territory on the palate. Flavors fall somewhat flat and the finish is muddled.
"The Blanc de Noir name would suggest it's a sparkling wine; it is not. The label also reads Estate White Wine. It is not. Rather, it is a rosÃ© of Pinot Noir, lightly orange in color. Flavors recall a Pop Tart sort of pastry, simple and slightly sweet."
"Made from certified organic grapes, this wine is both savory and tannic, a tad muted on the nose and wanting in texture. Cassis and pipe tobacco stand out most."
"Vanilla and maple aromas lead to overtly fruity red cherry flavors with a touch of sweetness and a soft texture. It's pleasant to drink for those looking for a soft touch, with very mild acidity and no tannin to speak of."
"This Viura-Chardonnay blend smells odd, as if musky cologne was blended with body oil. The palate seems caught between heavy and racy, while flavors of candied white fruits, apple and pear come with residual sugar and a sketchy foundation."
"Smooth but tangy, this offers good fresh citrus aromas and flavors, a softer-than-usual texture but a bright, clean character that stays fresh on the finish."
"Chunky, raisiny lead aromas come with more than enough vanilla, mocha and creamy oak backing. This has a lazy, baked, tannic feel and heavy flavors of candied blackberry and creamy oak. It smells and tastes forced."
"Grilled peach and almond notes show on the nose, while the palate is tighter in profile, offering apple pomace and lemon rind."
"Light and fruity, this is an attractive off-dry wine. It has a delicate spice character along with yellow fruits that are seasoned with pepper and acidity. Drink now."
"This herbaceous Cabernet also contains 17% Petite Sirah but doesn't take that variety's character on as much as it does the more herbal Bordeaux grapes, namely Cab and Cab Franc. Earthy and somewhat austere, the wine is a blend of cassis and green pepper."
"Almost two years of barrel aging have impacted this wine, which also appears to have spent a fair amount of time in bottle. The fruit is subdued and the texture chewy in leathery tannins that feel dry and unresolved on the finish."
"From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Tight in cranberry and puckering oak, it needs to air before enjoying."
"With aromas like sweet vanilla and candied cherries, and similarly syrupy flavors, this might make a better after-dinner wine than a table wine. The acidity and tannins are very subdued, so the overt fruitiness and oaky sweetness take over."
"Sweet and somewhat disjointed, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc offers ripe apricot and peach before becoming slightly sour and herbal on the finish."
"Oxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat."
Cinnamon and licorice gumdrop and sketchy cherry cough drop aromas make up the nose on this cloying Cab that also shows hard tannins. Baked berry and brown sugar flavors finish with little sizzle or balance.
"Tired and oxidized on the nose, this offers just-adequate freshness on the palate, but the wine is losing steam. Flavors of oxidized white fruits and bitter citrus finish dully."
"Gold in color, with a nutty, flabby nose. In the mouth, this is honeyed and mealy, while flavors of creamy oak, green herbs and stone fruits finish bland and soft."
"Aromas of raw oak, paint and dark-berry fruits lead to a medium-bodied palate with candied, oaky, mildly bitter black cherry and plum flavors. A modest finish closes with lasting bitterness and medicinality."
"Grassy, stalky plum aromas are decent but not overly fresh. Without a lot of shape or body, this modest Garnacha is herbaceous and limited in red-fruit flavors. The finish is gone in a flash."
"Both tart and tannic, it's unusually tight in personality, with a mouth-puckering texture, sharp fruit flavors and astringent finish. While there are too many soft and overripe Zins, this one goes pretty far the other way."
"Toasted sourdough bread and briny lemon show on the nose and palate, with dusty oak and slightly burnt toast on the finish."
"Aromas of blueberry and cinnamon smell odd and forced. A wiry-feeling palate runs on punchy acidity, while short flavors of currant and raspberry are oaky and finish with little structure or character."
"This is soft and lightly flavored. Fruit and some fresh acidity are there along with spice, but the wine seems muted."
"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over."
"Prune and raisin aromas announce ripeness, which comes with woodsy, earthy, murky berry scents. This feels snappy at first, then more heavy and baked. Prune and spice cake flavors are clumsy, heavy and lack cohesion on the finish."
"This is stalky, grassy and peppery smelling, with red-berry aromas. Rawness and sharp acidity keep the pulse up as basic flavors of plum and raisin take over. A modest finish keeps the course without evolving."
"An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe."
"This has both a taste of vanilla-sugar on the palate and bristling acidity that demands attention, making for a wine that's slightly off-kilter. The presence of oak is restrained and the finish, in keeping with the theme, quite tart."
"This GSM blend is soft and muted. It falls flat, with dull fruit and a wash of chocolate."
"The nose is rather closed but reveals whiffs of dark-skinned fruit. The diluted palate offers raw, red cherry alongside fleeting tannins."
"Fresh blackberry fruits give a smooth wine, rich and with an immediately attractive fresh acidity. It does have the density of fruit along with relatively soft tannins. At the back there is a more chocolate character."
This wine continues the upward progression of Clerc-Milon. It has weight and density while also showing sweetness and delicious acidity. A very complete wine.
"There is dense, ripe fruit here, although with an austere, serious edge. The wine has firm yet juicy blackberry fruits along with concentrated tannins. It is firm, dark, with the potential for good red berry fruits."
"So soft and sweet, it's like a melted dessert pastry. Explodes in blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with the smoky, buttery toast of oak barrels. Defines deliciousness. The tannins are soft enough to drink this 100% Cabernet now, and it is probably best enjoyed over the next six years before it loses freshness."
"Tinata is a sultry blend of Syrah and Grenache, a RhÃ´ne-style blend unlike any other wine in the area. These grapes seem perfectly adapted to the little-known region of Capalbio in the southern part of Tuscany and deliver intense aromas of blackberry, leather, chocolate and cured meat. It's plush, rich and extremely long-lasting."
"Siepi is a gorgeous 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that delivers intense aromas of ripe black fruit, rum cake, leather, moist tobacco and Indian spice. It lasts long on the palate thanks to its fine, silky texture. This vintage is slightly leaner, but brighter than the 2007."
"Firm and muscular, with mixed berries and cherry fruit, this beautifully defined Cabernet shows excellent penetration and focus. The finish is long, smoky, and carries a hint of gun metal."
"A stunning Syrah with 4% Viognier that's almost black in color and aching with deep, dark cherry and black licorice surrounded by a lush, dense herb garden. This is a heavy, rich California Syrah, practically a velvet curtain, that will appeal to RhÃ´ne aficionados and anyone with a taste for something big, accentuated by a smoky finish."
"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato."
"Poggio al Merli is a 100% Merlot that shows a perfect marriage between variety and territory. It's an opulent, soft and round wine that is woven tight with blackberry, pipe tobacco, rum cake and a touch of black olive. Velvety tannins drive a long, intense finish."
"Pitch-black wine, very dense. It is spicy with concentrated black fruits, layered with equally intense acidity. Wood, fruit and sweet berries are all there. Tannins surround this firm wine, promising aging over 5â€“6 years."
"With layers of wood, this is a structured wine, driven as much by tannins as fruit. It will need time for the dark plum fruit flavors to come throughâ€”St.-EstÃ¨phe is always likely to be firmly textured."
"Initially wood dominates, but this is a stage after bottling. Because then the ripe, smooth fruit comes in, pouring through with black fruits, very ripe and juicy. As this wine develops, this rich fruit will be its main character."
"The Doyenne MÃ©tier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% MourvÃ¨dre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!"
"It's sad that only 5,080 bottles of this wine were produced, as it's truly a stunner. Dark and developed, complex and concentrated, this wine exhibits such superb balance and finesse, with nuanced notes of minerality, scrubland, whole tobacco leaf, black pepper and licorice root all gracing the dark fruit core of the nose and mouth. It's lush and full on the palate, and medium tannins provide a solid structure, making the wine drinkable now or ready to age."
"One of the nicest Syrahs to come from Italy, Marchesale is a rich, inky wine with intense aromas of cherry, blueberry, cola, chocolate and leather. Balanced softness and freshness characterize the finish."
"This wonderful Brunello opens with sultry aromas of black fruit, cherry, spice, leather and tobacco. It's a rich and penetrating wine with a soft, lush mouthfeel and a hint of crisp acidity on the close. You'll want to keep this treasure in your cellar for a few more years."
"This 100% Syrah from sunny coastal Tuscany offers extreme softness and richness with chocolate, cherry liqueur, blueberry and smoked bacon fat. Pair this rich wine with game meat or stew."
"Based on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this luxe rosÃ© bubbly is delicious to drink now. It's likeable for the array of strawberry, orange and lime flavors, with that savory sparkling wine yeastiness, and the bubbles are smooth and refined. Will set off many different foods, but sushi is a definite hit."
"A wine that continues the impressive rise of du Tertre. It is becoming one of the sure values of Margaux, and this 2009 is both ripe and finely balanced. The acidity boosts the rich fruits, sweet tannins and the warm finish."
"Densely rich, very sweet wine. It has some smoky tannins that give structure, along with a dark core of dry raisin and wood flavors. It has concentration and an opaque texture."
"This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006."
"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat."
"The reason why this winery scores so well, year after year, in Chardonnay is because the production team knows how to get maximum ripeness out of the grapes, while maintaining an integrity of structure. The '09 Hyde exhibits this quality. It's fantastically rich in oranges, apricots, pears and pineapples, yet possesses a bracing minerality and fine Carneros acidity."
"A rich wine, full of dark plums, big and dusty tannins and a powerful core of dryness. The wood aging has brought out mint as well as spice, smoothing the rough edges to give an impressive and elegant finish. Keep for 4â€“5 years."
"This massive super Tuscan blend based mostly on Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon is thick, inky dark in color and particularly intense this vintage. Black cherry, spice, plum cake and leather are protagonists of the bouquet. The mouthfeel is smooth and incredibly rich."
"Big, bold and structured, this is a dry yet mouthwatering beast of a Shiraz, its blackberry, mocha and black olive notes held in check by firm tannins. Give it 3â€“4 years in the cellar, then drink it over the next several years."
"A distinguished, impressive Cabernet, obviously the result of fine grapegrowing and meticulous berry selection. It's bone dry, rich in tannins and firm, with mineral-infused blackberry and black currant flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Will develop bottle complexity for a good eight years."
"An outstanding Hellion, 44% Primitivo, 31% Petite Sirah and 25% Zinfandel. It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years."
"From old vines, at least 50 years old, this shows good concentration, giving a dense, ripe, rounded wine full of green apple fruits, hints of vanilla and streaks of minerality."
"A product of a hot, short growing season, Lake Folly's 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon shows some slightly overripe notes of cola and prune, but also features a high degree of richness allied to a broad, mouthfilling texture. It lacks nuance, but it is a big, flavorful mouthful that ends with hints of coffee and chocolate. Drink nowâ€“2010."
"Softer and more approachable than the winery's powerful 2005, this wine offers lush plum, leather and loam notes, accented by a touch of cracked pepper. It's full-bodied and creamy-textured, with a soft finish that invites another sip. Drink nowâ€“2012."
"Aglianico and Piedirosso grapes are blended to produce a thick and broad wine with an inky black color and notes of very ripe red fruit. It has a sweet, chewy aspect with vibrant, albeit densely extracted fruit and soaring tannins. Try it with a beef stew or similarly heavy dishes."
"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%."
"Sourced largely from the northern end of the region, this features bold blackberry flavors slightly reminiscent of preserves and marked by dark shadings of cola and chocolate. Yet despite the superripe flavors, the wine remains well structured and retains some slightly herbal overtones. Drink nowâ€“2012."
"Feudi di San Gregorio's distinctive take on the indigenous Greco variety favors a more saturated and concentrated style. The color  is slightly more golden and intense and the aromas reveal ripe melon, honey, dried hay and almond."
"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish."
"A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll. It's remarkable that McLaren Vale fruit can go into a $12 bottle. Black cherry fruit is presented on a medium-bodied, softly tannic frame, embellished by hints of cola and eucalyptus. Finishes soft, with a fine texture of charcoal dust and lingering cassis flavors."
"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible."
"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley."
"Complex mixed stone fruits dappled with sweet cinnamon spice lead into a fairly lush midpalate. The dominant flavor is fresh cut pear, and the creamy texture spreads the flavors broadly through the mouth. A lovely wine to match with halibut or swordfish."
"This is a cool cru, which shows even in this great year with its structure, austerity and steely character. It makes it old-style Chablis, with its green fruits and lively, poised freshness."
"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas."
"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel. Supple tannins on the finish suggest this will age well through 2012 or so."
"This boasts brilliant clarity, purity and aromas of orange blossom, pear, melon and peach. It's a tad flatter and creamier than other renditions of this native grape but nonetheless would make an idea match to fish, pasta salad or most chicken dishes."
"Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine. It's pretty tough in tannins right now, but the astringency frames ripe blackberry and cassis flavors that linger in the finish. Needs time. Best 2008â€“2010."
"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Ã€n has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012."
"Apricot, peach cobbler, sticky honey, white flower and macadamia nut color a seductively sweet wine from Puglia, the heel of the Italian â€œboot.â€ Thanks to strong sunshine and cooling breezes, Malvasia grapes lose their water mass, resulting in rich concentration and intense fragrances."
"A soft, medium-bodied wine that tends toward bright, red-berried fruit, this is a solid everyday Cabernet. Cedar and tobacco-leaf notes accent the cherry-berry fruit, while hints of vanilla and caramel linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now."
"A real crowd-pleaser, the 2005 Shingleback may not have quite the complexity of the 2004, but it's still a fun, approachable wine. Cola and coffee notes accent plum and blackberry flavors, while the broad texture coats the mouth with soft tannins. Drink nowâ€“2012."
"For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class."
"A nice interpretation of Grenache Blanc. Blended with a drop of Viognier, it shows notes of orange and peach jam, honey, vanilla and toasty oak. The alcohol level is high. Drink up."
"For lovers of red sparkling wine with its attendant tannins, this is a fine example. It has a definite Pinot Noir farmyard character along with tannins, a touch of smokiness, and a definite need for food."
"There is a creamy, leesy mouthfeel to this estate-grown Riesling, whose residual sugar is masked with acidity. Tart apple and pear fruit flavors finish with lighter notes of candied orange and citrus."
"Good and dry, with tough tannins that make it hard to drink now. With blackberry, currant, molasses and dark chocolate flavors, it seems like an ager, but may not have the concentration for the long haul. Try again in 2â€“3 years."
"Crusty aromas of black fruits mesh nicely with lemon peel and floral scents. The acidity here is noticeably high, which creates a scouring mouthfeel. Short flavors of berry and cassis are shrill, while the body and cushion offered by this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Viognier are modest at best."
"Rubbery red-berry aromas blend with spicy field scents to create a true Pinot nose that's a bit strained. This is intense, chunky and slightly herbal, with red-fruit flavors, spice notes and some heat and oak on the finish."
"Hay, straw, match stick and minerally aromas outweigh this wine's fruit scents by a measurable margin. This is chunky and a bit soft in the mouth, a reflection of 2012's heat. And while it's round as a ball, it's slightly vegetal and bitter tasting on the palate, with grapefruit and bell pepper flavors."
"This solid, structured wine has black currant fruit, balanced acidity and firm tannins. The wine has a solid texture, a core of dryness and the potential to age 3â€“4 years."
"Under the serious amount of wood, this wine feels rich and concentrated. Wood spice, a touch burnt, along with chocolate and black currant fruit show both extraction and the need for 2â€“3 years' aging."
"Solid and tannic, very firm from the opening to the finish. It is based around a dark core of wood and spice as well as more juicy fruit flavors. The wine needs time to round out and bring more of the juiciness to the fore."
This is a rare beast from Washingtonâ€”single vineyard Tempranillo aged in neutral oak coming in at less than 13% alcohol. It's soft and light with notes of red fruit and refreshing acidity that drops off on the back half.
"Grape and spice aromas give this wine a distinctive heady perfume. A rare style to find in the Wachau, it brings a fine balance between fruit and perfume with the textured nature of Wachau wines. Ready to drink, or age for a year. Screwcap."
"Easy to drink this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, with Merlot predominating. It's all about cherries, blackberries, plum jam, currants and chocolate. Not particularly subtle or ageworthy, but very pretty."
"This opens with a good mix of tobacco, black cherry, cola and mocha aromas. In the mouth, this offers good body, size and balance along with lightly herbal, leafy flavors of mossy black fruits. A mellow finish with a solid structure is a welcome ending."
"This opens with evident oak aromas of toasted wood, espresso and coffee bean followed by underpinnings of black fruit and pepper. The palate shows ripe black fruit, espresso and oak. Although it has nice depth, the finish is cut short by by drying wood tannins."
"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley. But the greenish tannins bring a lot of herbal flavors to the forefront, and tend to bury the fruit."
"Dense planting for this vineyard has resulted in a wine that has greater concentration than in the past. The wine has firm tannins, while showing already delicious black-currant fruit. For drinking over the next 2â€“4 years."
"This is a pretty, well-made Barbera with an invitingly floral and fruity bouquet. The palate shows ripe black-fruit flavors accompanied by touches of spice, coffee and chocolate. This would be perfect with grilled meats."
"Mondavi's done it again, produced another very nice Cabernet at an everyday price. It shows classy elegance, with blackberry, currant and mocha notes."
"This is a soft, appealing Chardonnay layered with toasted marshmallow and superripe peach. It's round in the mouth and lushly textured, then turns citrusyâ€”almost metallicâ€”on the finish."
"Here's a refreshing and attractive Chenin Blanc that offers clean notes of ripe pear, green apple and honewdew melon alongside accents of cinnamon and white florals. The palate is light weight and vibrant, with lifting acidity that adds zest to the medium-length finish."
"Fruit and spice aromas show dark cherry, white pepper and toasted oak aromas of espresso and chocolate, with a hint of orange peel. The palate has fresh strawberry, coffee and citrusy notes but not much depth."
"Fine, rich black-fruit flavors give this wine a sense of ripeness, openness and generosity. The wood and fruit balance is already fine, showing that it will be ready to drink this year."
"Mint marks the nose of this otherwise darkly attractive wine. Notes of mocha and plum nicely set up the wine, as do the supple tannins, but then there's a jarring edge of prickly acidity that cuts across the palate and disrupts the flow. There are some nice parts here that don't quite come together."
"Tea, tomato, raspberry and spice aromas are typical for Leyda Pinot. The body is a bit light and hollow, but that also means it's not heavy. Raspberry and spiced tea flavors control the palate, while plum, spice and light herb flavors work the almost dilute finish."
"With a bit of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this Cab is marked by hard tannins and blackberry and cherry jam, black currant and oak flavors. The finish is gripping, however, it's pretty tart, and you have to wonder if that sharpness will ever age out. Decant and drink up."
"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot opens with fiery, oaky aromas that include cherry, cassis and vanilla. The palate has a severe tartaric shear to it along with clampy tannins. High-toned flavors of raspberry and plum are propped up by blazing acidity, while the finish is herbal and peppery in taste, with a scouring feel."
"A green, minty wave of challenging aromas comes with black olive, coconutty oak and graphite. The palate is bullish, scratchy in feel and tannic, with feral, herbal flavors of blackberry, juniper and wild herbs. Herbal and wild are the best words to describe this Syrah."
"Aged in 68% new French oak, the barrel notes take center stage here with aromas of toast and spice. The palate is creamy and full with a viscous feel, tapering in concentration toward the finish."
"Ripe fruit, sweet tannins and soft texture mark this wine. It's full, ripe and lightly structured. An attractive wine for its black fruit and forward character. Drink in 2â€“4 years."
"Fruity wine, light, elegant with a touch of minerality, it shows a fine balance of green fruits and its spice. The wine is all about freshness, crispness, a touch of minerality to give texture. At the end, the fragrant acidity shines. Screwcap."
"It's not easy to get 16.5% alcohol from a vintage as cool as 2010 in Washington. The wine has a grain and grass bouquet, wild and brambly fruit, and plenty of Asian spices. Interesting, though not especially typical for the grape variety"
"Not the richest Chardonnay ever, but it has complex notes of citrus, apple, nectarine and tropical fruits, with kisses of vanilla and cream. Acidity gives it elegant brightness."
"Great value, simple and fruity, this is a ripe wine without wood aging, just bursting with black fruit flavors. It's rich, slightly stalky and ready to drink now."
"This is an enormously rich Cabernet. It explodes in milk chocolate, black cherry, spicy plum and sweet, toasty oak flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Delicious, if a bit one-dimensional. Drink now."
"Made in a richer, riper style, this Zin brims with flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants and brown sugar, like a Christmas fruitcake. The alcohol is quite high. Drink soon."
"This is a fine, all-purpose red blend, mostly Cabernet, with time in one-third new French and American oak. Heavily charred, smoky and earthy, it's got a fair amount of dark cassis fruit to carry all the barrel toast and finishes with some notes of bark and stem."
"Lots of early-drinking charm in this Pinot Noir. It's light and silky, with a modest alcohol level that makes it easy to drink. The raspberry, cherry, cola and oak flavors are delicious."
"Scratchy berry aromas come with a hint of sweet-smelling plastic, but overall this bargain-priced Cab is good and welcoming. The palate has a pure, medium-bodied feel, while flavors of baked berry, cassis and chocolate finish with a mocha taste and mild heat."
"This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish."
"A cool, very Sauvignon wine, with strong herbaceous and citrus flavors. It's crisp, showing a bright, tight, slightly mineral texture."
"There's a honeyed note to this wine, yet it's crisp in acidity, giving it a mouthwatering savoriness for drinking now. The flavors veer toward Asian pears, peaches and tart gooseberries."
"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through."
"On the nose, this Cab delivers a mix of vinegar, rubber and jumpy berry aromas. The palate is smooth but bland and soft, while flavors of licorice, prune and herbal notes finish easy."
"Yogev, meaning â€œtiller of the soil,â€ is a friendly and easy-pleasing wine, with direct notes of cherry skins, fresh cassis and black currant leaf. Medium weight, with moderate acidity, fine tannins and a clean, fruit-driven finish. Drink now."
"This Chard's oak accents pineapple and lemon fruit flavors. It's dry yet honeyed, that paradox of Chardonnay, with a good burst of citrusy acids for brightness."
"Bold and fruity, this is laden with bitter cherry and juicy plum flavors. The tannins are light and attractive, with juicy, refreshing acidity. Age this for a few more months."
"Rich and dense, this has blackberry and black cherry jam, mocha and spice flavors. It contains 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, which lends the wine weight and body. While it's technically dry, there's a sweetness that comes from the ripeness of fruit and the caramel flavor from the oak, which gives it a sugary, bacony taste. Delicious now and for a few years."
"Rich, exotic notes of honey-glazed papaya and warm pear are accented by touches of white flower, graham cracker and lemon custard. The palate feels round and weighty, with flavors that aren't as effusive as one might expect. Acids provide enough spine to keep the palate from drooping, with hints of clove and lemongrass adding interest. A blend of 55% Chardonnay, 45% Viognier."
"Fresh and clean, this Vermentino offers ripe aromas of apricot and peach, with background tones of citrus and pear. It's extra smooth and silky on the close."
"This blend of Incrocio Manzoni and Vermentino opens with bold floral intensity, plus solid background tones of peach and lemon mousse. It offers a creamy, soft mouthfeel that could stand up to white meat or shellfish."
"This has acidity and tannins that are rich and complex. The raspberry, cola and licorice flavors have a nice coating of smoky oak."
"This is dry, full bodied and pretty tannic, with a sense of elegance, plus flavors of sour cherry candy, red licorice, tobacco and sweet, smoky cedar."
"This has a firmly tannic structure and juicy fruit, suggesting its aging potential. It is rich and ripe, with black cherry and plum flavors that create a generous finish."
"The light-framed aromas of strawberry and raspberry are clean and citrusy. The palate on this wine made by the Chablis-based producer Laroche is crisp, tangy and juicy, with flavors of raspberry and cranberry that are fresh and tight. A clean, honest Pinot to enjoy now."
"Sporting a much-improved label design, the 2009 Natasha brings pungent, assertive scents of tomato leaf, pepper and moist earth. Sharp and focused, the fruit is there, though it's the leaf and earth components that stand out. For its earthy style, it's a well-made and complex offering."
"This is a savory, elegant, concentrated effort that doesn't show too much sweetness. Dark fruit, spice, black olive and tobacco notes appear on the silky close."
"Cherry and blackberry notes dominate this ripe, full wine. It has a smoky, toasty character that lends good balance and aging potential. The estate is planted with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon."
"Tough tannins set the scene for this firm and extracted wine, giving it a smokiness and a touch of bitter fruit. However, the wine has the weight to support the tannins, and it hints at future juicy fruit. Keep this for at least five years."
"Showing a mineral-driven structure and firm tannins, this is a Beaujolais that needs to age. Rich and juicy, its perfumed red fruits currently cut through the dry tannins."
"This is full of crisp, herbaceous flavors of apple, grapefruit and lime. It has weight and concentration, with some richness to its freshness. Acidity cuts through on the finish. Age this for 2â€“3 years."
"Made from Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio, this shows bright berry aromas of blackberry and cassis, with cola, dried ginger and polished mineral notes. The mouthfeel is clean and bright, with a touch of chopped mint."
"At just 12.6% alcohol, this might seem underripe for warm climate varieties, but it tastes perfectly full and nicely balanced. It's tart and lemony, to be sure, and in fact makes a fine accompaniment to fresh-shucked oysters."
"This is the most complete of the four Prince Hill clonal selection bottlings. It has flavors of cherry, Dr. Pepper, cherry candy and a hint of incense. It's a pleasant, easy-drinking wine best consumed while still young."
"Fleshy, bold and well concentrated, this Primitivo di Manduria delivers sweet fruit flavors of blackberry pie, prune and raspberry jelly. The wine is soft and chewy, with a bright note of fruity sweetness on the finish."
"This is the second wine of ChÃ¢teau de MercuÃ¨s, and it has some of the same concentration and tannins as the first wine, without the huge and powerful structure. It will develop its black cherry and spice flavors relatively quickly, to yield a ready-to-drink wine in 2â€“3 years."
"This offers ripe cherry and blackberry notes, followed by bright acidity and a palate that bears medium density. It's a great food wine to pair with breaded veal, sausage or meatloaf."
"This gorgeous Greco di Tufo opens with bright aromas of pear, peach and crushed brimstone. In the mouth, it tastes fresh and fruity. Pair it with crab cakes or Thai vegetable rolls."
"This best-of-barrels Chardonnay is oaky, offering waves of butterscotch and buttered toast that dominate the tart underlying flavors of pineapple and lime. It's certainly rich and well-structured, but quite oaky."
"Soft, sweet and appealing, this has raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with an oak-influenced note of buttered toast. It's an easy, gentle wine, with some real depth and complexity."
"Plumbago is a pure expression of Nero d'Avola that portrays the natural characteristics of this indigenous Sicilian grape. Red berry, cherry, almond skin and pistachio open the bouquet and give way to zesty freshness on the palate."
"This smells deep and bass-like, with resonating notes of honeyed white currant, spiced breakfast toast and apricot preserves, accented with touches of caramel and toasted nut. It feels round, rich and opulent, with a nice lift of acids that give the wine some spring."
"This Syrah offers bright tones of leather, cured meat and blackberry. Smooth and long-lasting, the palate boasts loads of bright berries."
"An exotic, spicy Pinot Noir, this is medium-bodied and crisp, with complex cranberry, raspberry, red licorice and smoky sandalwood flavors. Drink this dry, silky effort now."
"A blend of Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault and Counoise, this is bone dry and brisk in acidity, with complex flavors of mineral, herb, sour cherry candy, red currant and white pepper. Although production was only 2,000 cases, this wine is worth the search."
"For a Morgon, this is relatively light, showing more fruit than structure, with freshness that's tempered by a firm edge and minerality. Keep for a year, or drink now."
"Berry and cherry aromas are surprisingly sturdy and clean. Freshness is maintained on the palate, which is honest enough to offer modest tannic bite. Lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors change little on an easy finish."
"Gritty aromas of stewed berry, lemony oak, green herbs and tin set up a tannic, chewy, highly extracted palate that's lacking in elegance. Flavors of chocolate, green herbs, blueberry, vanilla and plastic finish oaky and creamy, with lasting heat."
"This is serviceable but rather bland, with a dusting of cinnamon spice and simple, tart fruit."
"A lightly fruity wine that has a soft texture, gentle acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. It is ready to drink with its steely backbone well enmeshed in the fruitiness."
"Initial plum and berry aromas fall off with airing and reveal notes of chemical and chewing gum dust. On the palate, this blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Tannat is chewy, sticky and flat. Modest but sweet berry flavors veer toward molasses prior to finishing without much acidity or verve."
"Aromas of latex, plastic, clove and wild berry fruits try to come together. A hard, high-acid palate is narrow and choppy, with biting tannins, while a salty flavor profile that includes blackberry finishes woody and savory, with a lasting taste of clove."
"Gritty, roasted berry aromas are rubbery and hint at Band-Aids. In the mouth, this is O.K. in feel, albeit a bit jammy and thick. Short, generic berry flavors come with minty accents and some green on the finish."
"Lemon curd and artificial butter show on the nose and palate, with underripe peach adding verve to a creamy body."
"This full-throttle, oaky Chardonnay features an intriguingly curious mix of corn nuts, diesel and marijuana on the nose. The corresponding layers of flavor are straightforward and simple."
"Despite its single-vineyard designation, this watery effort could be from anywhere. Thin, dilute, barely ripe strawberry fruit vanishes quickly once in the mouth, and there is little trace of any barrel flavors from aging in 20% new French oak."
Fruity aromas that recall blueberry and pomegranate carry over to the lean palate along with brisk acidity.
"Towards the dry end of the Pinot Gris spectrum, this is a crisp, apple and pear flavored wine that has a light character. It's fruity, crisp and ready to drink."
"This wine has a light, fresh character to go with the ripe spiced fruits. It's smooth with a tangy lime-zest flavor filled out with yellow fruits. Drink now."
The nose isn't very expressive but reveals white flower and tropical fruit. The simple palate delivers pineapple and lemon zest alongside brisk acidity.
"Dusty aromas of red cherry are muddled by oaky notes of plastic and latex. A jumpy, bright palate is rudimentary, as are lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors. A fresh, dry, basic finish seems appropriate."
"Dry, spicy aromas aren't overly ripe or expressive. In the mouth, this basic Cab is raw, racy and spiky in feel. Flavors of herbal red-berry fruits are leafy, while finishing flavors of carob and pepper register as adequate."
"Soft, floral and fruity, this is a rounded wine with a gentle texture, yellow fruits and light acidity. There is a good touch of spice to fill the wine out right at the end."
"Underripe fruit seems more sour than anything. Some bitter, stemmy flavors creep into the finish."
"This wine looks and tastes bright pink. It is creamy, not quite dry and soft, although the aftertaste shows some fresh acidity. Crushed strawberry flavors suggest that it will pair well with fruit salad."
"Made from CastelÃ£o, the local grape of the SetÃºbal region, this wine is as bright and clean as possible. The light texture makes it ideal for summer drinking."
"The style is all perfume, recalling straightforward lychee and spice wine. It has a rounded texture, soft and medium sweet, and is ready to be enjoyed."
"This is soft and easy in texture, light in flavors and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied, it has very little tannin or astringency, is low in acidity and quiet on the finish."
"This is light, fruity and fresh for a Gewurztraminer. A crisp character brings out bitter orange and ripe pear flavors. Drink now."
There's no mistaking the grape in this spiced and peppery wine. Candy-shop aromas and bergamot flavors go together with a light acidity to create a wine that's drinkable now.
"Amid the blackberry and asphalt tones, this has a funky rubber twist on the nose. The bottling is a side label of Avelina, founded by former Oreana Winery owner Christian Garvin. It's tart and sour on the palate, with dried raspberries and a bit more funk."
"Dusty aromas of balloon rubber and apple juice are sketchy, but in the mouth this is fair and balanced. Flavors of lychee, mango candy and sweet papaya finish soft and lightly oxidized."
"This wine is all about perfumes and spice. It's ripe, fruity and already drinkable. Bergamot and fruity candy dominate the light acidity and soft texture."
Melon and citrus aromas are yeasty and a bit sulfuric. This feels plump and juicy but not exact or well cut. Flavors of briny apple and nectarine turn bitter and salty on the finish.
"This wine is soft, rounded and smooth. With just enough acidity to give a fresh character, it is ripe with pear and quince flavors. It's ready to drink, light and fragrant."
"Produced from a number of parcels around the village of Katzenthal, this is a fresh and fruity wine, easy to drink. It's bright with acidity, flavored with ripe quince and apple fruits. It's ready to drink."
"This attractive blend of Chardonnay, Arinto and Vital is fresh, fruity, packed with apple and lemon flavors and totally ready to drink. There's a great line in acidity, a crisp texture and a green, lively aftertaste."
"Made from Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, this is one of Rock Wall's drier, lower-alcohol wines. It's high in acidity, with a silky mouthfeel. A little rustic, it shows cherry skin, tobacco and white pepper flavors."
"Ready for drinking now with its raspberries, currants, persimmons and oak. The acidity is bright, and the finish is clean and spicy. Pair now with lamb dishes."
"It's a midnight-black wine, full-bodied and tannic, with immense black currant, grilled meat and black pepper flavors that finish bone dry. Already throwing some sediment, it will live for two decades, without gaining in complexity. Drink nowâ€“2025."
"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this 100% varietal wine doesn't quite seem to have fully ripened but still offers plenty of enjoyment with its savory notes of leafy herbs, olive and cherry. It's elegant in its styling with a fresh feel and a cinnamon-speckled finish."
"This vibrant wine begins with aromas of apples, stone fruit and mineral. The savory palate offers ripe Bartlett pear, citrus and peach alongside bright acidity. It closes on a bitter almond note."
"Spicy and savory, it offers aromas of white and black pepper along with raspberry, dark cherry and hints of bell pepper that carry over to the palate along with aggressive tannins. Drink 2015â€“2021."
"Sourced from a single vineyard, this spent 17 months in French oak, 38% new. It's light and spicy, with pleasant fruit flavors of apple and pear."
"Reedy berry aromas mixed with herbal notes set up a chunky, voluminous palate. Spicy flavors of olive, green herbs, tobacco and oak run alongside berry and plum fruit. On the finish, a resiny oak flavor and herbal notes meld then fade away. This is 55% CarmenÃ¨re, 30% Petit Verdot and 15% Syrah."
"With touches of vanilla and caramel as well as ripe yellow fruits, this is a warm, generous Chardonnay. It has freshness from the citrus edge and a soft texture. Straightforward, it is an open and ready-to-drink wine."
"A familiar Chilean mix of berry, plum, spice and herbal aromas feed into a lifted but prickly palate that supports roasted, earthy flavors of berry, cassis and olive. A racy, slightly rough finish is home to spicy, chocolaty flavors on top of residual herbal berry."
"Aromas of green apples, peach and citrus carry over to palate. The juicy flavors are accompanied by lively acidity that makes this wine very food friendly."
"Aromas include white spring flowers, tropical fruit and a hint of graphite. The juicy palate offers green apples, white peach and melon alongside fresh acidity. Delicate almond marks the close."
"A fifty-fifty blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, this densely concentrated wine has aromas that suggest underbrush, wet leaves, black berries and prune. The palate delivers fleshy black cherry, raisin, black pepper, espresso, bitter dark chocolate and a sugary vanilla note alongside solid tannins. It's at its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon."
"With brisk acidity, a bone-dry finish and some dusty tannins, this is an interesting Pinot Noir, with a silky texture and cherry jam, pomegranate and cranberry flavors that are ready to drink now."
"Very Douro in its mineral texture and dry core, it also has a surround of ripe black fruits. It's concentrated and has some aging potential, although it can be drunk now."
"Still young, it is full of spice from wood aging along with juicy black fruits. It is soft, dominated by black currant and acidity. Not for aging, it will be ready by the end of 2014."
"Dry and tannic, this 100% Cab has flavors of herbs, blackberries and tea. It's a tough wine not showing generosity now. You can age for a couple years, but the tannins will outlast the fruit."
"This Syrah, Grenache and MourvÃ¨dre blend shows hot alcohol and superripe flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and raisins. It's a big, rich, thick wine that sticks to the gums, almost syrupy, but fully dry. Decant it and drink with stews, casseroles, barbecue."
"Floral aromas of white spring flowers partner hints of pear and stone fruit. The juicy palate offers white peach, apple and green melon alongside a mineral note and fresh acidity."
"Subdued aromas recall Alpine wild flowers and lychee. The fresh, linear palate offers Golden Delicious apples and citrus notes with a hint of wax alongside crisp acidity."
"A dense and rich, jammy Merlot that is full of black fruit and has an ultra-ripe feel. It is hardly Bordeaux, but it does hold attraction with its rich, full fruits and dense tannins. A smoke and bitter chocolate aftertaste suggests some firm extraction."
There's a beautifully delicate nature to this wine that is evident in its pristine floral aromas and its feminine notes of raspberry and wild berry. Hints of smoke and tar appear at the end and the wine is tight and firm in the mouth. Don't worry about longevity; there's enough pulp and structure to guarantee a   long aging future ahead.
"With 14 years age, this Champagne shows plenty of beautifully mature fruit. At the same time, its petrol and toast aromas and flavors are balanced by soft richness, a rounded citric and pear flavor and a gentle, ripe aftertaste."
"This is a balanced wine, moving easily between rich fruit and a tight mineral and grapefruit texture. There is a hint of toast to give extra weight. Worth aging for several years."
"Earns a high score for sheer richness and decadance. Huge in blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, bacon, pepper and oak flavors, wrapped into big, velvety tannins. Impresses for its size, but is totally dry, and retains balance and elegance. Nowâ€“2015."
"Barolo Gramolere offers an attractive window onto the Nebbiolo grape with peek views at its inherent complexity and elegance. The wine opens with a ruby-garnet color and offers aromas of wild berry, white cherry, tar, licorice, hazelnut and ginger."
"Barolo Bricco delle Viole is a lush and generous wine with a bright ruby color and attractively intense aromas of cherry, wild berry, nutmeg, clove, powdered licorice and root beer. The oak influence is still obvious at this early stage, but will no doubt integrate with time. The mouthfeel is exceedingly soft, smooth and velvety. You don't need to wait too many years before uncorking this bottle."
"Very different from the Bricco delle Viole cru expression from the same producer, this wine offers bold, ripe fruit with lingering tones of red cherry, leather, charcoal and campfire. The fruit is thick and succulent and the finish offers sweet, succulent spice flavors. Multiple U.S. importers."
"This Barolo with the vocally challenging name Pichemej reveals a dark and moody side that is reinforced by aromas of black fruit, plum, pressed rose, tar and asphalt. There's a textured, earthy quality here followed by firmly drying tannins. Pair this wine with tender beef ribs."
"This Barolo exhibits sweet aromas of berry fruit, Christmas spice and vanilla. It's a bold, confident wine with a smooth but firm quality in the mouth that hits all the right marks. Pair this Barolo with marinated lamb and dried fig jelly."
"From slate and limestone vineyards, this is an intense wine, full of tropical fruit flavors, spice, toast and hints of ginger. The wine rolls richly around the mouth, a gorgeous, opulent texture."
"Very rich in texture while also balanced, this is a wine that shows extreme concentrationâ€”honey, yellow fruits and final sugar all wrapped in lively acidity."
"Intense acidity, with the sweetness held in check by a bright, crisp character. Rich honey is balanced by an exquisite freshness, lightly perfumed, so clean and clear in final taste."
"Both crisp and rich, a magical combination with beautiful acidity, light currants, the whole wine infused with honey. The final acidity leaves a long-lasting aftertaste."
"A beautifully accessible wine, polished, pretty and likeable now for its gentle texture and silky tannins. The sweet cherry and raspberry fruit is encircled with a coat of fancy smoked oak. Made from 100% Cabernet, the wine is balanced enough to gain bottle complexity for a decade."
"Here's a powerful Cabernet Sauvignon, ripe and opulent, offering summer blackberry, sour cherry candy, currant, dried herb and rose petal aromas and flavors. The addition of 21% Merlot brings a candied softness, but it's still pretty tannic, and wants 4â€“5 years in the cellar."
"Here's a very attractive and seductive Barolo with chiseled mineral tones that really help the wine stand out in a crowd. Layers of graphite and slate give purity, linearity and clarity to this austere and elegant expression. Earthy tones, as well as forest berry flavors, appear on the long finish."
"Founded in 1986, Tenuta Rocca is a hilltop property in Monforte d'Alba that overlooks some of the most beautiful landscapes in the Langhe. This wonderful Barolo opens with sweet smells of candle wax, nutmeg, ginger, chocolate and bright red fruit. The wine imparts a squeaky clean, polished feel in the mouth."
"Mario Battaglio offers a truly fantastic expression of Nebbiolo from the hot 2007 vintage that is packed tight with intensity and larger than life aromatic opulence. In a surprise twist, the wine also boasts a feminine side thanks to delicate aromas of wild flowers, licorice and light graphite or mineral shadings."
"Barolo Bricco Rocca still needs a few more years in the cellar to allow for full integrations of its spice, fruit, tobacco and mineral components. This beautiful wine is ripe with potential and the mouthfeel is plush and velvety with a wonderful fade of smoke and black fruit. Drink after 2018."
"Here's a wine that begs a pairing with a truffle dish: black truffle Cornish hen or creamy risotto with white truffle flakes would do the trick. Cannubi San Lorenzo's aromas include spice, cherry, cola, white licorice, white mushroom and smoked ham. This is a beautiful wine with a firm, determined but elegant finish."
"Here's a vineyard-designate Barolo Riserva with pristine aromas of cherry, wild berry, smoke, tar, licorice and leather. The streamlined mouthfeel is polished yet firm, and the wine offers a long fade of cherry and spice flavors."
"The prized Cannubi cru offers fruit that is interpreted by some of the finest winemakers in northern Italy. This expression from the dynamic Damilano winery is characterized by tight tannins, power, personality and ripe berry flavors. Pair this Barolo with risotto topped with thinly shaved truffles."
"Very different than the 2005 vintage, Barolo Le Coste from Giacomo Grimaldi opens with a brownish-amber color and ripe berry or candied fruit aromas. There are beautifully fine aromas of tar, asphalt and licorice in the background that help balance it out. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers."
"This brilliant Sauvignon Blanc should be scooped up by sommeliers. It's exceptionally dry and tart in citrusy acids, with a mineral scour that's perfect for shellfish or savory appetizers. The flavors are of lemons, limes, gooseberries and white pepper. Beautiful and compelling."
"From 100% grand cru Chardonnay vineyards in the CÃ´te des Blancs, this is a rich but almost bone-dry wine. It has a great mineral character that offers freshness, apple skins and a flinty edge. The disgorgement date is indicated on the bottle. Impressive, this would benefit from six months' aging."
"From a cool part of the valley, this wine is marked by fresh acids that give it a grapey jamminess. It's very rich in black cherries, black raspberries and toast, and very dry. Feels sharp and angular now. Give it through 2010 to calm down."
"A beautiful GewÃ¼rz that could get more people to drink this Alsatian variety. It's dry and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, honeysuckle flowers, lychee nuts, vanilla and Asian spices."
"You want black pepper? You'll get plenty of it in this dry, interesting RhÃ´ne blend of MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah. It has briary flavors of wild blackberries, with an edge of leather, tobacco and herbs, and is thoroughly dry. Pretty tannic, too. An interesting wine, and one to watch."
"A very fine Cabernet, dry and firm, but it needs a little time in the cellar. Astringent now, it has a deep core of black currants and cedar, with the polished tannins that Napa so easily crafts. Try between 2010â€“2012."
"Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth. Aging for 18 months in new French oak brings in coffee and chocolate, balanced and subtly displayed. Nice details of leaf and leather run richly into the tannins."
"A good Cab, dry and balanced, whose tannins are richly impressive and sweet. Shows a good tension between the oak and the ripe black currants. Easy to like, and should develop for a few years."
"Elegantly structured, with firm tannins, a silky texture and a fine balance of fruit, acidity and oak. Shows cherry, red currant, cola and sandalwood flavors that are delicious, but those tannins close in on the finish, making the wine hard. Try after 2011."
"A 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this shows big fruity flavors tempered with a dry core of tannins. There is a stalky element of black currant skins which adds to the sensation of dryness, but there is also a more mouthfilling character of black plum juice to give the wine a final roundness."
"This is a thickly extracted Amarone with fruit-driven aromas of strawberry, cherry and blackberry preserves. It is inky and dark in color with impenetrable density and a smooth quality to its tannins. Allegrini is one of the most historic and well-respected producers in Valpolicella."
"Tangy berry/black cherry fruit is backed with lots of acid and hints of earthy funk. It's not vegetal but it is definitely herbal, a complex and flavorful reserve that falls right between Balboa's regular Syrah and the Sayulita."
"LamorÃ¨mio is a blend of Nerello Mascalese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola in equal parts that tastes of Indian spice, clove, sweet cinnamon and blackberry. You'll also get a touch of caper or green olive that rides on the heels of the wine's smooth, supple mouthfeel."
"Il Monovitigno is a pure expression of Nerello Mascaleseâ€”Mt. Etna's most promising varietyâ€”with aromas of black olive, Indian spice, mesquite, black fruit and volcanic ash. It's tonic and fresh in the mouth and encourages a pairing with spicy meat recipes."
"A richly Merlot wine, soft, ripe, packed with black jelly flavors, sweet acidity and generous balanced tannins. The flavors come together in a balanced, rich way. An attractive wine, ready to drink now."
"Opulence is the reserve Syrah, a firm and juicy wine with dark, smoky, wild berry flavors. It's gamy and brambly, chewy and tart, and it has the length and polish to sustain your interest through glass after glass."
"We won't call this the best Terrunyo SB to date, but it is typically clean, mineral and full of lime and passion fruit. The overall balance and purity are up the ladder, while the flavors of green fruits, passion fruit, brine and lime don't hold back. Top notch SB from Chile to drink now."
"Following the elegant Deutz tradition, this wine has a character that is light as a feather, but still anchored into vivid red fruits and tight acidity, leavened by a softness. The final taste is soft, but well integrated."
"Ripe and oaky. May fall a bit short on complexity and finesse, but makes up for it in sheer power. Pineapple crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, spicy green apple butter, ripe pear, Asian spices and smoky oak are the flavors, backed with firm acidity."
"Young and fresh in citrusy acidity, with forward fruit flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, cola, bacon and sweet oak. Good and dry and silky, but immature."
"This is an example of a lighter, drier style of Cabernet that maintains great elegance and charm. It's very dry, showing blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors wrapped into firm tannins, and brightened with crispness. Best nowâ€“2011."
"Aggressive smelling early on but then it settles on classy raspberry, cassis and herbs. The palate is very healthy, juicy, rich and big, but the flavors of dark berry fruit are subtle and smooth. Chunky, sweet and ripe on the finish. A Malbec to drink this winter. Only 300 cases produced."
"It's been a while since we've reviewed this wine, so this is a fine comeback. Plum, blackberry and rubber aromas are solid, but the real star is the palate, which is smooth and thick, with lush dark fruit flavors and a smoky background. Good, slightly herbal and long on the finish."
"It's hard to make Petite Sirah smooth and elegant, but Newsome-Harlow has done it. The wine shows classically fine tannins, while the flavors run toward milk chocolate, ripe blackberries and lots of crushed black pepper. Delicious and refined, a great wine for peppersteak."
"Great now with lamb, this Pinot is softly complex and forward in fruit, with a silky texture. It shows cherry, raspberry, mocha, anise and smoky oak flavors. Best now and for a few more years."
"This is Peju's best Sauvignon Blanc in many years. It's bone dry and elegantly crisp in acidity, a clean, vibrant, food-friendly wine. With just a hint of oak, it shows rich flavors of Meyer lemons and limes, with exotic notes of papaya and white flowers. What a great comeback."
"Could almost be Zinfandel, it's so spicy and briary, with wild berry, red currant and tobacco flavors. But it's lighter in body, with the silky texture of Pinot Noir, and drier than any Zin could be. A lovely, complex and food-friendly wine."
"If you want to taste ripe Pinot Noir in Champagne, this grand cru blend (with 40% Chardonnay, 60% Pinot Noir) from Soutiran is where to come. The wine has weight, delicious white fruits and kiwi, and a textured mouthfeel. It is concentrated, certainly in a food wine style."
"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blendâ€”two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrahâ€”is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age."
"Named after local nobility in the city of Borba, this is a popular brand in Portugal. In its white manifestation, the wine is soft, very clean, with pear and cinnamon flavors, the texture just moving toward fat, but working well as a food wine."
"Honey, kiwi, mango and peach come to mind and color an easy, but fragrant Grigio from the mountains of northern Italy that would pair well with exotic or Asian foods. It closes with spicy acidity and is a perfect palate cleaner."
"This Pinot Grigio from northern Italy has good density and direct aromas of honey, peach and grapefruit that make for a well balanced ensemble. The wine is fresh and clean and would pair with grilled calamari or Thai mango shrimp."
"A fine, crisp wine, with delicious green apple flavors and a tang of lime, a touch of yeast, and a dry, fresh aftertaste. There's a delicious bite to this fragrant wine."
"A nice, crisp Chard that has pineapple, peach, pear and caramel-vanilla flavors that turn honeyed and spicy on the finish. From the Sonoma producer Ty Caton."
This delightful Pinot Grigio offers remarkable clarity and precision and generous tones of stone fruit and citrus while being creamy and rich in density. Pair it with your favorite seafood recipes.
"Forward and easy in cherry, currant, raspberry, tangerine zest, cola and peppery spice flavors, this Zin has a gentle texture. There's also a wealth of firm, dusty tannins that could help the wine age for a few years."
"Creamy and full in the glass with thick streaks of glycerin, this is a luminous white blend with pretty aromas of stone fruit, honey and peach cobbler. The wine has a smooth, full consistency and a soft, generous finish."
"Dark, soft and rich, this single-vineyard Pinot brims with deep, almost brooding flavors of red currants, cherries, red plums, mocha and dusty spices. It also has an edge of tannins that will help it negotiate a good steak. Drink over the next several years."
"Former Wild Horse proprietor Ken Volk is back with his own personal brand after selling the winery. He's sourced his fruit from this very famous old vineyard. It's a good start, a deep golden wine showing ripe apricot, pear and sweet smoky oak flavors."
"A very easy wine to like. It's so softly balanced, so rich in cherries, licorice and smoky vanilla, so light in texture, you could drink it as a cocktail wine. But it will also nicely complement a wide variety of foods."
"This Manzoni (a cross between Riesling and Pinot Bianco) opens with a pretty, luminous glow and offers pristine aromas of stone fruit, mango and vanilla. Natural structure and smoothness underscore the variety's pairing potential with most Thai or Indian dishes."
"Although Pinot Grigios are white wines, you could consider this a rosÃ© instead because of its luminous copper color. The wine boasts a thick, creamy consistency and has a generous, plush feel in the mouth. It's a special and carefully crafted wine."
"Ripe, smooth, just veering toward rustic, but also showing a fine balance of tannins and sweet fruit. It is certainly rich, while the spicy character, with the dried fruits, is generous. The acidity is understated."
"A little sweet, dense and pasty on the nose, and that's also how the wine plays out. It's a ripe style of CarmenÃ¨re, with brooding but not overly expressive black-fruit flavors. Ripeness is clearly not an issue as it shows no vegetal or herbal notes. Simply big, bold and not terribly unique."
"This is a fuller and creamier rendition of Pinot Grigio with pretty aromas of honey, peach blossom and melon that give the wine a fragrant aromatic lift. It leaves a lean but smooth impression in the mouth and ends with bright citrus flavors. Imported by MW Imports."
"You don't think of Livermore Valley as Pinot territory, but this is a pretty nice wine. It's medium-bodied and silky, with pleasurable flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, vanilla and smoke, and a long, sweetly spicy finish."
"This delicious Chardonnay offers creamy opulence and rich notes of vanilla, honey and peach. It has dense, slightly sweet, fruit flavors lavished over good structure and ends with spicy crispness. Pair it with white meat or pasta salad."
"This Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend is very much in a Washington style, with crisp acids and tart berry and currant flavors, wrapped in chocolate and showing a few specks of pepper, presumably from the Syrah. It's solid and well-made and a good example of how Oregon vintners are breaking out of the Pinot box."
"Here is a full-force Pinot Bianco with compelling notes of mature apricot, candied fruit, honey, pine nut and maple syrup. The wine has a saturated, golden hue and resin-like flavors that add texture and dimension."
"A blend of 70% Clairette, 15% SÃ©millon and 15% Rolle, this is a slightly nutty, almondy white with touches of honeyed richness and apricot. Turns a bit astringent on the finish."
"Here's an interesting rosÃ© fans of obscure winegrapes will love. It's 90% Tibouren, an old variety indigenous to Provence that's known for its finesse but also for its difficulty in the vineyard. This wine also stays an entire year in tank resting on its lees, so it's not a fruit-forward rosÃ© at all. Hints of apricot and peach are subtle, with the emphasis being on the wines crisp acids and dry finish."
"Ripe and juicy, this is packed with black currant fruit and lined with soft, open tannins. The wine has a dry core, yet this is surrounded by attractive smoky fruit and bright acidity. Ready to drink now."
This is a very rich wine with black fruit and bitter coffee flavors and dense tannins. Its weight is almost too much for the firm structure that is underneath.
"Big fruit aromas of plum, raspberry and a whiff of pepper start this enjoyable red from Gerovassiliou. On the palate, flavors of spicy black fruit, clove and smoke appeal and should pair well with grilled meat dishes and stews."
"This delivers the soft, velvety texture you want in a nice Merlot, along with ripe black-cherry, anise, cola and sandalwood flavors that finish dry and spicy."
"Tart and juicy, this nicely balanced Riesling mixes fruit flavors of orange, Meyer lemon and tangerine. The acids are natural and tangy, and the overall balance is just right."
"A blend of approximately 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot making up the remainder, this barbecue-ready wine is scented with dried herb and forest floor components. Brambly berry fruit and tart acids work to balance out the earthy tannins."
"Andis's 100% Barbera tempts with ripe, dried black-cherry and mint flavors, and toasty layers of coffee and toffee that linger until the finish."
There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts. Initial notes of tomato leaf and green stem blow off to reveal aripe red fruit with a gorgeously floral character. Tart acidity and a concentrated red-cherry flavor are accented with graphite and black tea notes.
"Packed with superripe Merlot, this is rich and round. It has wood flavors and sweet, juicy black-plum fruits that are balanced by firm tannins. The finish shows some bitterness from over-extraction."
"Now maturing, this retains its red fruits; its bright texture and acidity go with the firm tannins and dark structure. It is balanced and ready to drink."
"This is structured and firm, with its dry tannins prominent along with blackberry and black cherry acidity. The wine does have density, a dusty texture and the chance to further age."
"This shows the rich density of Merlot in 2009, giving a solid structure, with dried fruit and red berry flavors and a concentrated line of tannins. Big and dense, this is ready to age."
"A very rich wineâ€”this has a warm, soft mouthfeel and ripe, jammy flavors enhanced with oak. Except for the heat, it's a lovely wine. Drink now."
"Easily as good as Chardonnays costing two or three times as much, this is a great value, and with production at 12,000 cases, it should be fairly easy to find. It's rich in orange, apricot and buttered toast flavors, with balancing acidity and a dry finish."
"With a rich, velvety texture and flavors of black cherries, green olives and smoky cedar, this is a very nice Merlot for drinking now. Drink this with upscale fare."
"This is 75% Merlot, with Cabernet, Malbec and Syrah comprising the other 25%. Despite all of the components, it tastes like there is a bit of a hole. The fruit is soft and plummy, and the overall balance is excellent."
"This opens has a bold appearance with dark extraction. The aromas that follow are reminiscent of ripe cherry, cinnamon spice, plum and pulpy black fruit. Round and soft, this closes with firm grittiness."
"One of the small Sauvignon Blanc areas close to Sancerre, Menetou-Salon produces a light, crisp and herbal style of wine. This fits that bill well, its freshness contained within the flavors of hedgerow fruits and tangy acids."
"Everything in this wine is strong and obvious: With its powerful tropical fruit, sweet oak and intense finish, this is what many Americans like in Chardonnay. But as impressive as the winemaker's art is here, the flash is all on the surface. Drink up."
"Smooth and rich, this has superripe Merlot. It has soft, jammy red-fruit flavors and tannins that are enveloped by the opulent texture. The tannins should allow the wine to age over 3â€“6 years."
"Blackberry, tobacco and spice flavors give this an appropriate air of sophistication. It should pair with pizza or pasta."
"Here's a rustic zesty red that has aromas of ripe berry, game and whiff of tilled soil. The gamy note carries over to the simple, quaffable palate along with ripe black cherry and a hint of dark spice. Drink soon."
"Clover and apple aromas are basic but fresh. This is simple on the palate, with little to the mouthfeel. Vapid flavors of soda crackers, spent yeast and apple cider disappear on a quick finish."
"This superripe, late-harvest style of wine smells like raisins and dried plums. It tastes so fruity and ripe that it's sweet, with a full body to match. It would be best as a dessert wine."
"Brassy in color and woody in aroma, this Chardonnay is a pleasant enough drink, offering ample weight and modest pear and citrus flavors. Drink it through 2017."
"Rubbery raspberry and plum aromas are decent. This feels crisp and abrasive on the surface, but sort of empty in the middle. Lean snappy plum and raspberry flavors end with scratchy tannins and a medicinal aftertaste."
"Purple flower and mature dark berry aromas lift out of the glass. Extremely simple and diluted, the palate offers suggestions of morello cherry, a hint of spice and loose-knit fleeting tannins."
"Candied berry aromas lack crispness. This feels hard, with little give and depth to the palate. Burnt toasted berry flavors are hot and fall off on a clumsy finish."
"Grassy stalky berry aromas lean towards green. This feels grippy, while spicy herbal berry flavors stay the course and finish with minty green notes on top of basic plum and berry."
"The wine is lean for the vintage, tight and with an austere structure. Its tannins and juicy red fruits are in the background. The aftertaste is dry and firm."
"Too alcoholic for its own good, the wine is full bodied and heavy. It has tannins, superripe black fruits while missing structure and acidity. It is developing fast and will be ready to drink from 2017."
"Light aromas of red fruit, game and vanilla are followed by quite tart puckering fruit flavors. It needs food to counteract the screaming acid."
"This pink wine smells of red-apple skins. The palate is low on acidity but not entirely dull. Dry briny lightly bitter flavors don't show a lot of fruit, while this is pulpy on the finish."
"This shows the tannic chewy, vegetal nature of the grape, without off-setting it with other flavors. One-third new French oak has made little impact, and the wine is rough and astringent through a quick finish."
"This easygoing, informal wine offers subdued aromas suggesting cassis, raisin and a note of dried herb. The simple palate shows mature plum and a hint of clove alongside fleeting tannins."
A whiff of cellar floor and powdered sage lead the nose. The simple diluted palate offers dried black cherry and an earthy note alongside fleeting tannins.
"The tannins are firm, still controlling the black fruits in this wine. It is concentrated, with considerable extraction giving a dry wine with a hard edge. The red-berry flavors are lost."
"Most of the action is on the outside of this gaudy bottle. However, this light and slightly sweet wine has appley, floral flavors and a soft, easy texture."
"Heavy oak aromas sit atop wiry plum and spice scents. This feels tannic and tough, with up-front oak and herbal berry flavors. A dry tannic, spicy finish features palpable oak that tastes forced and like plastic."
"This light-colored and light-bodied wine combines an earthy, metallic aroma with mildly fruity, candied flavors. Its texture is mild and smooth."
"Prickly berry aromas include notes of both candied raspberry and cinnamon. This feels a bit clunky and sticky, with sugary berry flavors and a slightly cloying finish."
"Dusty aromas of desert brush, oak, blueberry, animal hide and green herbs are strained. This feels raw and choppy, while reedy herbal red-fruit flavors finish with a note of raisin. This Monastrell (with 10% Syrah) is okay but all over the map."
"Briny, cidery aromas are a touch stale. This has a basic citrusy mouthfeel along with flavors of orange and tangerine that turn mildly bitter and pithy on the finish."
"The aromas are light, with notes of white flowers, green herbs and peach. The flavors are tart and elegant in style, seeming quite watery in concentration."
"A fruity wine with soft tannins that is ready to drink. It has banana, red cherry and light spice flavors, finished off with attractive acidity."
"This wine is ripe with red fruits and soft tannins. It is smooth, packed with red-berry flavors lifted by the acidity. Made to be drunk young, it is ready now."
"Easygoing and enjoyable, this has aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, violet and an earthy whiff of truffle. The juicy simple palate offers black cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside supple tannins. Drink soon."
"Aromas of plum, violet and a whiff of spice emerge on this extremely simple red. The short diluted palate suggests red cherry and a hint of vanilla alongside frail tannins."
"Slightly sweet and quite light in body, this wine has modest peach and herb aromas, generic fruit flavors and a soft texture."
"Lemon and apple aromas precede a high-acid citric palate without much elegance or finesse. This pedestrian AlbariÃ±o deals pithy orange flavors that come with a note of grape skins. On the finish, this seems like orange juice."
"High-toned aromatics complement aggressive, unintegrated flavors of raw wood. It's lumber, not toast, that you taste, along with bitter tannins and little evidence of ripe fruit."
"Crushed stones and river rocks take center stage in this elegant off-dry Riesling. It's gorgeously mineral, yet also anchored against a backdrop of crisp cutting yellow-peach, tangerine and lemon flavors. It's a zesty, invigorating wine with a clean but persistent finish."
"Peach and blossom notes abound on this delightfully fresh fruity wine. Its sunny stone-fruit flavors are concentrated and juicy, balanced against zesty lime acidity and a meandering pollen finish. Sprightly in texture yet buoyant."
"Thyme and crushed herbs on the nose of this red lead into flavors of sweet spice, smoked meat and boysenberry. The wine has an exotic spin and a balanced overall character. Elegant and distinctive."
"Strawberry and watermelon highlight a light, creamy palate of vanilla and lemon peel, the freshness maintained by moderate acidity."
"Pretty and floral, juicy and substantial, this wine delivers in flavor and texture, conveying caramel, baked pear and pineapple. Notable oak wraps around the fruit, ending with hazelnut and nutmeg."
"A touch of smoky petrol in the aroma and flavor adds intrigue to this full-bodied, creamy-textured wine. A lot of effort in the winery, including native fermentation, 33% new French barrels and lees stirring helped it have a good sense of depth and richness without being overripe, contributing a mouthflling sensation and lingering finish."
"The restrained nose just gives a glimpse of lemon freshness. Lemon notes intensify on the palate, where they attain a lovely textural feel of pith and zest. A slender wine, it still carries a hint of yeast on the midpalate, but is subtle, clean, slender and fine. The finish is dry and refreshing."
"Tight and focused, this opens with aromas of wild berry, red rose, culinary spice and a whisper of menthol. Chiseled and austere, the palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and a hint of anise. Youthfully assertive fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provide the framework. Give it time to soften and fully develop. Drink 2023â€“2033."
"This 100% varietal wine brings lightly styled aromas of green grass, herb, snap pea and whiffs of green pepper. The palate is full bodied and textured, bringing a sense of richness but never losing its balance. It lingers on the finish."
"Rose petal, underbrush, grilled herb and game aromas take shape in the glass along with a balsamic note. On the firm full-bodied palate, hints of baking spice accent ripe (almost overripe) morello cherry and raspberry. Close-grained tannins give it an assertive finish. It's already almost accessible. Drink 2021â€“2028."
"Made as an ice wine, this sweet treat smells nutty, honeyed and a touch earthy It tastes rich, like salted peanuts coated with toffee and apricot syrup. The texture is viscous, palate-clinging and persistent, holding unctuous flavors for a long finish."
"If you are of the school that says rosÃ© from Provence is the world's gold standard, then give this excellent newcomer a try. Brief skin contact has created a light color and sense of elegance on the nose and palate. Flavors of cantaloupe and peach are lightly sweet but cut by ample acidity. Drink as soon as possible to capture this wine's fresh essence."
"Pretty pink in color, this wine is inviting in aromatics, offering a depth of fresh strawberry and watermelon atop a substantial mouthfeel of body and weight. It finishes balanced and dry."
"Medium in build and lengthy with layers of flavor, this vineyard-designate offers a wealth of rhubarb, pomegranate, cherry and black tea, the background built around strong notions of forest floor."
"Soft notes of green bell pepper, nettle and grass give this a fresh aspect. The slender palate then adds lemon, giving a focused zestiness, with glimpses of boxwood. The wine is citric, slender and very refreshing."
"This aerated, yellow-tinted brut nature smells mature, bready and buttery. The palate is full bodied, yeasty and anything but sweet. Salted citrus and papaya flavors are nutty and hold steady on a slightly flat finish. Drink now."
"A year older than the other rosÃ©s tasted for this report, this is mossy and developed, yet retains a hint of red berries. It's earthy, chocolaty and rich, with along, lingering, savory finish. Drink up."
"Aromas of tobacco, wood grain, plum and cherry set up a plucky, lively palate with hard tannins. Spicy plum and berry flavors finish steady and drawing. Drunk now through 2023."
"Don't let the playful label fool you, this is an impressive, dry wine. Big, very ripe and fruity, it also has a good grippy texture due to firm tannins and acidity that make it appetizing. The color is quite dark, and the black cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors run deep."
"Lemon zest, mango and flowers lead the nose on this elegant Malagousia. Smooth and silky with juicy orange and citrus flavors, the wine has an elegant overall character."
"This wine is 95% Sangiovese and 5% Aglianico, hailing from Seven Hills, Loess, Mill Creek Upland and Serra Pedace vineyards. Aromas of cranberry, raspberry, and fruit leather lead to quite tart cranberry flavors. The concentration doesn't quite seem all there to stand up by itself but it should fit in well at the dinner table."
"Fresh lemon, sea salt and grapefruit aromas lead this buoyant pour from Crete. On the palate, appealing flavors of ripe lemon, tropical fruit and spice give it weight enough to pair with heartier dishes. That said, it finishes clean with a peppery finish."
"This offers aromas of red berry, leafy underbrush and a whiff of chopped mint. The juicy palate delivers succulent black cherry, orange zest and ground pepper alongside sleek tannins."
"As effusive in flavor as a bowl full of orchard fruits, this wine exudes fresh apple, melon and spearmint aromas backed by ripe yet crisp flavors that carry a vein of apple blossoms. It's not sweet, but it has a pleasant softness around the edges of the mouthfeel."
"A touch of Riesling accentuates the fresh citrusy backbone on this Cabernet Sauvignon rosÃ©. Dry in style with a sprightly light-footed tone, it offers loads of concentrated cherry and berry flavors. The finish is brisk and clean."
"Quite powerful and oaky in style, this full-bodied wine matches ripeness with firm tannins, carrying a hint of brown-sugar sweetness from the aroma through the finish. It's dry, but the spicy effect of new-oak barrels adds a pastry-like accent, which the texture balances with a welcome bite of astringency."
"Slightly sour Meyer-lemon-pith aromas meet with honeysuckle and yellow pear on the nose of this bottling by veteran Bob Lindquist. There is a strong sizzle of acidity on the sip, where green-apple flavors meet with tart nectarine and lime-peel zip. It's very fresh and food-friendly."
"Black-cherry-cola aromas along with lots of licorice and Dr Pepper spice show on the nose of this bottling from a relatively new winery in northeast Paso Robles. There is slight sweetness to the palate, with baked cherry and baking-spice flavors. Accents of dried blackberry, leather, dried meat and purple flower add complexity."
"Boisterous blueberry, black cherry and black-currant aromas make for a hedonistic nose on this bottling that also offers a sultry line of cocoa, espresso and clove spice. The palate shows similar layering, from black-cherry compote to herbs to black olives, proving unique overall."
"This wine is a unique in the state blend and features Cinsault (35%), Grenache (35%) and MourvÃ¨dre. Pale peach in color with a slight bronze tinge, the aromas are light, with notes of strawberry, citrus zest and mineral. The flavors are dry, sleek and high acid. It's a perfect summer wine."
"Highly herbal aromas shadow black cherry, plum, oregano and beet scents. This feels plump and full, while the flavor profile is pure CarmenÃ¨reâ€”herbal, minty and peppery as well as black-fruit driven. Heat, herbs and spice are draped on the finish of this love-it-or-leave-it Chilean specialty."
"Fresh-squeezed lemon and jalapeÃ±o open the bouquet of this wine, kosher-made in Berkeley by Covenant. With the right pairing, it'll sing, offering medium texture and a lengthy finish, the acidity balanced and in keeping with the fresh elements of tropical fruit and citrus."
"Floral aromas like lilac and lavender, then dry and substantial flavors like blueberry and boysenberry give this full-bodied wine an interesting personality. It tastes well structured with acidity and tannins, so it's well balanced and has an appetizing sense of reserve that will be great at the table."
"Rich aromas of black cherry, anise seeds and buttered violets greet the nose on this dense bottling of a grape that rarely gets solo treatment. The palate is tarry and grippy, with dried sour cherries, boysenberry, black pepper and tightly grained cedar flavors that approach pine sap."
"Aromas of ripe black plum, underbrush and exotic spice come together on this brawny red. The firm palate offers black cherry extract, blackberry jam, licorice and mocha alongside chewy tannins."
"While the nose gives little away here apart from the slightest lemon flavors, the palate is lightly textured and shows straitlaced lemon freshness with bright rays of zesty fruit. It's an ideal, refreshing apÃ©ritif for warm summer days."
"Smooth and spicy, this wine explodes in layers of cinnamon and clove dusted in sugary plum and black cherry, a powerful weight and degree of ripeness at its core. The finish is soft and lengthy in vanilla oak."
"This solidly good block selection shows shy aromas of dark red and purple fruit with a touch of earth and asphalt. The palate is tart and tight, with a bit of sagebrush nuance."
"Produced by the Terravant facility in Buellton, this shows lots of smoked pork and bacon fat against a boysenberry-fruit frame on the nose. Flavors are quite sanguine, with iron and blood elements, as well as more smoke and some dried herbs."
"A blend of predominantly Merlot and Syrah, this wine offers aromas of raspberries, herbs, plum and vanilla. The flavors are sweet, plump and juicy, delivering a lot of bang for the buck."
Vibrant aromas of tangerine and flowers lead to sweet fruit flavors that show persistence. Enjoy it as an apÃ©ritif.
"Nutty aromas of popcorn, buttered toast, peach and apple create a solid nose. This feels lively but also a bit oily. A mix of roasted nut, wood resin and pineapple flavors finish toasty, with racy acidity working as a preservative."
"With 58% MourvÃ¨dre, 20% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 2% Counoise grapes from the dry-farmed, head-pruned Old Oak Vineyard (formerly Sheep Camp Creek), this wine shows dried black cherries, pencil lead, uncrushed cloves and nutmeg on the nose. The palate is flatter, with cooked cherries as well as other dried purple and red fruits."
"Generous, sweet pear fruit tumbles out over palate and throat, held carefully in check by fresh zestiness. This is about easy fruit and simple pleasure, held in beautiful balance. Drink soon."
"A soft and layered expression of dense black cherry, chocolate and spicy tobacco, this is easy to enjoy and approachable, rich and round. A taste of black licorice dots the finishing moments."
"Dusty and leathery on the rustic nose, this shows slightly sour dried red fruits and anise. The palate is all about earthâ€”sand, clay, dirt, etc.â€”along with plump, ripe cranberries and cinnamon spice."
"Concentrated in toasted marshmallow and juicy blackberry, this is a large, full-bodied wine marked by puckering tannins that still need time to resolve. Powerfully built, it's big on flavor and intensity, with vanilla on the finish."
"A strong note of grapefruit skin and juice, from ruby red to yellow, melds with crushed chalk and cider on the nose of this bottling. The citrus zest is prominent on the palate, as is more apple cider and a solid pithy grip, proving quite intriguing texturally."
"Rounded rose and honey notes with inflections of apple and Mirabelle are cut very pleasingly by the citric freshness of tangerine peel. This is easy drinking, medium bodied and aromatic."
"Produced with dried Garganega grapes, this boasts aromas and flavors of dried apricot, baked apple, citrus zest and toasted sensations. It ends on a note of roasted hazelnut."
"With a good structure, this is a solid wine from a small vineyard. It is dense with tannins as well as dark berry fruits and fresh acidity at the end. The wine will age well over the next few years, so drink from 2017."
"Lime pith, sharp gray slate, steel and a warmer lemon-curd aroma show on the nose of this wine from a region between Morgan Hill and Gilroy. Apples and pear-skin bitterness mark the palate that grows riper through the sip."
"This is round and mouthfilling without being fat or blowsy, finishing fairly crisp and dry. Along the way, hints of apple and citrus alternate with almond skin and cinnamon, providing a delicate balance of fruity and savory."
"The mellowness of baked apple envelops all other aromas. While the baked apple is also apparent on the palate, it is pulled into sharp focus by fresh, lively and bright lemon acidity."
"Herbal, spicy tomato and red-berry aromas come with oak-based coffee notes. This feels full, saucy, fresh and largely complete. The blend is Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with the wine's aromas translating to flavors of stalky berry and coffee. Spice notes and dry tannins push the finish. Drink through 2019."
"Despite opening with saucy, earthy, gaseous aromas, this mountain-vineyard Pinot delivers textural balance and modest acidity in support of peppery, toasty, spicy flavors of dried cherry, tomato and earth. A mildly spicy, round finish provides for a good ending."
"This is tropical, boisterous rendition of the grape, with heavy tuberose, white lily, peach and apple-blossom aromas. The palate combines honeysuckle, ripe apple flesh and pineapple-guava flavors."
"Warm aromas of red cherries, star anise and cinnamon greet the nose with inviting brown spice scents on this entry-level bottling. Cinnamon, cranberry and black plum show on the palate, along with pencil-lead minerality and a tart plum-skin finish."
"The toast, freshly ground coffee, dark chocolate and cherry aromas pop. Plum and chocolate flavors are smooth in feel and linger on the finish."
"Shrouds of leafy herbs and savory stems lend a fresh tone to this brisk yet fruity, concentrated Cab. Crisp blackberry and currant flavors shine bright and pert on the palate, framed squarely by lingering strikes of tannin and acidity."
Opens with dark concentration and extra flesh and density in terms of texture. There's an extra padding of softness that helps buffer the vintage's high acidity and natural firmness. Not ready to drink for another 10 years at least.
"A rich and sophisticated wine, with loads of dark fruit and exotic spice. It's bright ruby-garnet appearance, with bright acidity and a fresh, lively finish."
"Tenuta di Sesta is run by a perfect father-mother-daughter-son team and is located in one of the least-traveled corners of Montalcino. The 2007 Brunello delivers sweet oak tones that drive the initial bouquet and are soon followed by bright cherry, vanilla bean, sweet mocha and rum cake. Pretty balsam notes at the back will undoubtedly increase and evolve with age. Cellar this wine 10 years."
"At this stage, the wine is all dark structure and very firm. It will need time to develop its full potential as an intensely rich wine. Concentrated and firm, it is powered by tannins as well as sweet red fruits. So age for five years at least."
"The ripe fruit element is perfectly contained and just short of seeming overdone or jammy. It's soft and round, with loads of oak-driven spice, like cinnamon and ground clove, and plump tones of red cherry, blackberry and plum. What's really nice is the freshness and overall supple texture."
"Made from eight vineyards located throughout this sprawling appellation, this wine showcases the art of the blend, and is an extraordinary achievement for its sheer opulence. Offers wave after wave of Pinot flavor, with superb tannins and mouthwatering acidity. The fact that this is Merry Edwards's least expensive Pinot Noir is amazing and makes it a special buy. Production was 2,370 cases."
"Well stitched together with a broad, wide assembly of dark fruit, spice and cola-like aromas. All the wine's elements sing loud as a single chorus; bold, plush, chewy. Ends with ripe fruit, rum cake, pipe tobacco and dark espresso bean. Firm, great length."
"A lovely Pinot, dry, crisp and silky, with ripe raspberry, strawberry and cherry fruit flavors, grounded by notes of grilled mushrooms, exotic spices and forest undergrowth. Sweetly delicious now, it should blossom over the next six years."
"This wine has some big shoulders. There's a dusty, aged quality, with sophisticated, silky tannins and tertiary aromas of black licorice, dried tobacco, peppercorn and dried berry fruit. It's firm, tight and compact; age 10 more years."
"Madre is the name of a beautiful vineyard parcel on the Poggio Antico estate, with views that extend from Montalcino to the Mediterranean Sea. This hearty blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon is intense and rich, with long-lasting notes of blackberry, smoke, spice and black pepper. The mouthfeel is lush and velvety."
"This Brunello delivers an intense and complex bouquet featuring beautifully integrated aromas of dark fruit, spice, leather and tobacco. Tight tannins promise a long future ahead."
"You know you're dealing with a great Pinot Noir when it's this delicious right out of the bottle, yet will age. This wine is enormously rich and sweet in cherries, blackberries, blueberries and cola, a wine that almost everyone will find delicious. Yet with thick tannins and brisk acidity, it has the protective structure to evolve over at least six years, and possibly longer."
"Opens with dark concentration and ripe berry fruit with layers of plum, blackberry, dark chocolate, pipe tobacco, cherry liqueur, cola and underbrush. It offers a wonderful 360-degree portrait of Sangiovese Grosso. Tight structure, integration and loads of fruity intensity. Drink after 2018."
"This beautiful riserva opens with dark concentration and bold berry notes spanning from cassis to blackberry. It's a ripe, extracted wine with savory spice and cured meat aromas that fill in the back. Crushed black pepper and cardamom also make a brief, but lively, appearance."
"Just wonderful, showing the great richness and complexity of a top Santa Rita Pinot Noir. Partial whole-cluster fermentation gives the wine a spicy earthiness and full-bodied tannins, yet the underlying red berry and cherry fruit shines through. Showing well now and over the next six years."
"This full-bodied wine opens with compelling aromas of black fruit, smoked bacon, leather, cinnamon and crushed clove. There's a sassy, spicy characteristic here that is further underlined by the wine's natural sweetness and roundness."
"Austere, tight and sophisticated, this well-extracted Brunello shows dry aromas of crushed granite along with ethereal tones of dried ginger, black licorice and root beer. Inky appearance with chewy richness. The mouthfeel is round, chewy and packed with sweet fruit and spice. Drink after 2015."
"One sip is all it takes to know this is a terrific Pinot Noir. It's dry, silky and complex, and not only that, it will develop bottle nuance over the next six years. Rich and flamboyant in cherry pie filling, persimmon and mushu-plum sauce flavors, yet layered with earthy, foresty notes of mushrooms, soy sauce and balsam. You can drink it now, but give it an hour or two of decanting."
"While the texture of this Pinot is silky and light, it's dramatic in flavor. The cherries, plums, pomegranates and persimmons are packed together into a dense core of taste, all spiced up with cinnamon, cloves and anise. Feels dramatic and complex, but young and fresh in acids and tannins. Give it 5â€“6 years."
"This successful riserva displays opulence and a bold, modern style that focuses on bright cherry and savory spice aromas. The wine is loaded with density and richness, and combines a ripe soft feel with a lively berries on the finish."
"While the aromas of this young wine reveal considerable toast, on the palate the wine brings forward the ripe apricot and mango flavors to go with that wood. As it matures, these elements will coalesce with the taut, tense mineral texture into an superb, ageworthy terroir-driven wine."
"This rich wine balances ripe yellow fruits with intense citrus acidity in a harmonious whole. Its structure is laden with minerality, toast and a smooth, delicious creamy aftertaste."
"The vineyard is in the coolest part of the Green Valley of the Russian River Valley. The wine, which is totally dry, is marked by brilliant acidity and long hangtime flavors of oranges, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruit, enriched by barrel fermentation and aging."
"Here's a gorgeous wine with a deep, inky color and super extraction that is elegant but powerful at the same time. This is a balanced wine, but it's also an intense wine, with loads of ripe fruit, spice and tobacco. It feels smooth and rich, with a finely crafted texture that is velvety and supple."
"This is a lovely Brunello with black cherry, plum, smoke, bacon, leather and a drying touch of crushed mineral on the nose. It is rich and concentrated, with a slightly sweet-smelling bouquet. The mouthfeel is compact, tight and polishedâ€”but there is excellent length too."
"Inky color, with a broad array of aromas, including earth, candied fruit, plum cake and cinnamon spice. Smooth and luscious in the mouth, where its tight structure shows promising potential for longevity."
"A terrific Pinot Noir, from a winery compiling a serious track record. Grown on the Napa side of Carneros, the wine shows classic Primo's Hill character, with the blackberry pie, cola, mushu plum and sandalwood flavors accented by a little more acidity than usual. Defined by elegance and complexity, it's an ager, although it's beautiful now right out of the bottle. Should easily develop through 2015."
"This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit. Although it's a bit hot in alcohol, you hardly notice it, with the explosion of blackberries, raisins and chocolate-covered cherries, made even richer by smoky-sweet oak. Delicious now and through 2014."
"A bit disjointed, with acidity sticking out, and the fruit tending toward jammy blackberries, raspberries and nectarines, leading to sharpness in the finish. Could mellow and improve in a couple years."
"A good Cab, chockful of grilled blackberry, cassis, cocoa and sweet smoky oak flavors that finish rich and spicy. Has some real elegance, at an affordable price."
"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex. Flavors of baked plums, cassis and licorice are nice, and the finish brings chocolate brownie into the game. For immediate drinking."
"Rich, savory and appealing now for its smooth texture and forward flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries and oak. A lovely wine for grilled steaks and chops."
"Not a wine for the faint of heart. Alluring notes of raspberry, blackberry, smoke and coconut set the scene for powerful flavors of strawberry and black pepper in the mouth. Tannins are abundant but polished. The finish is a bit of a disappointment, with a whisper of astringency and a huge hit of coconut. Still, well done and fairly priced. Drink with steak."
"Pro Nobis is a good example of the RuchÃ© grape (a mysterious variety from Piedmont with some similarities to Brachetto). The wine offers aromas of wild berries and blue violets, backed by medium consistency and bright acidity. Pair it with cheesy pasta dishes."
"86-88 Barrel sample. Densely structured wine, all rich plums and berry fruit flavors. There is a strong amount of wood, but it is the juicy, just green, character of the wine which is most prominent."
"86-88 Barrel sample An aroma that is almost port-like in its sweetness. To taste, the structure is lost in a swathe of ripeness that covers the fruit."
"Tonic and fresh with vibrant tones of wild berry and forest floor, there is a rustic, almost savage quality to this wine that is really quite attractive. It would pair well with home-cooked meals of hand-kneaded pasta or boiled meats."
"86-88 Barrel sample. Firm, with a bitter, tight edge, this has high acidity, spice, and a tight layer of tannins. For a second wine, this is not that accessible."
"One of Italy's most interesting and least-know wines, Sforzato di Valetellina is made with dried Nebbiolo grapes in much the same way Amarone is made. In fact, sforzato means â€œforcedâ€ in Italian and alludes to the extra concentration given to the wine. With herbal and some bitter, leafy green notes, it's not a wine for everyone; it's sour in the mouth with an acid-driven close."
"There's a tonic quality to this Pinot Nero that combines ashy mineral notes with wild berries, toasted almonds and blue flowers. There's also a warm, sun-drenched quality that adds to the overall intensity and concentration."
"86-88 Barrel sample. Despite its initial edge of bitterness, this develops as a dense wine, packed with dark high toast and blackberry jelly flavors. The final bite of high extract spoils the finish."
"This is the lightest of the GrÃ¼ners from Proidl, offering a refreshing burst of crisp acidity along with the freshest spice. There is a fine tang of lemon, to keep the whole wine as bright as possible."
"Andy Beckstoffer is starting to release wines from his Red Hills vineyards, and this release is promising, especially at this price. It's fruity and tasty in blackberries and cherries, while oak adds rich notes of caramel and vanilla. Rich and savory, this Cab delivers lots to like."
"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you. Needs a grilled flank steak to play against."
"Made in a lighter style, this silky Pinot Noir has crisp acidity accentuating flavors of cherries, red licorice and cola. It's an elegant wine for drinking now."
"Here's a big, bold Zinfandel that shows the variety's rustic, briary character. It's dry and tannic and rather high in alcohol, with flavors of wild, ripe forest berries, peppery spices, currants, bacon and sweet, smoky cedar. Nice now with BBQ."
"Rich in fruit and oak, but balanced with crisp acidity. It's strongly flavored, brimming with pineapple jam, white peach, apricot, buttered toast and vanilla. Gets the Chardonnay job done with some elegance."
"A very nice Bordeaux-style blend ready to drink now. It's soft, dry and complex, offering waves of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, cedar and herbs, wrapped into fine, rich tannins."
"Smoke and struck-flint notes add a dark tone to this savory, herb-inflected white wine. The palate is round and rich, and finishes with a reverberating hint of salt and bitter lemon rind."
"Crisp. dry and fruity, this wine has a light touch of citrus and fresh acidity. Fruity with a slight sparkle, it's an ideal apÃ©ritif."
"Sweet-pea and citrus flavors are pleasant, along with a welcome touch of creamy oak for richness. But there's also hints of green, unripe fruit in this dry, crisp Sauvignon Blanc."
"Oak dominates the overall character of this wine, with forward notes of toasted wood, tobacco leaf, roasted coffee bean and a hint of plum. There's more wood than fruit here."
"Made from Sangiovese and a bit of Colorino, this has an earthy nose of truffle and underbrush, with a hint of iris and a whiff of leather. Reflecting the forward nature of the vintage, the palate is soft and warm, with sweet wild cherry, plum and round tannins. Drink soon."
"There's no denying the fact that this smells stalky and burnt, with leathery fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's choppy, with scratchy acidity leading to a loud flavor profile with stalky berry, raisin and stewed flavors. Heat and additional roasted notes drive the finish on this Malbec."
"This blend of undisclosed varieties is a charming red wine to drink now. It's dry, smooth and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Beef is its natural partner."
"Light in color, this is a fruity, softly tannic and lightweight wine. It brings out red fruits that are now maturing, giving spice and a touch of pepper with final acidity. Drink now."
"There is loads of freshly crushed black pepper in this dry, robust Zin. It's almost enough to make you sneeze. You'll also find good blackberry fruit and heady alcohol. Drink up."
"Light to the point of being a bit dilute, this Viognier has a cotton-candy character, like spun sugar around rhubarb. The tart, not quite fully ripe fruit brings it to a quick, acidic finish."
"This shows delicate floral aromas along with dominant bell pepper and sawdust sensations. The palate is dominated by oaky flavors of roasted coffee beans and espresso, giving the wine an anonymous personality and style."
"Aged mostly in stainless steel with a touch of new French oak (10%), this has notes of toast and char along with freshly cut mango. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, drinking just a hair off dry with a bitter note on the finish."
"AlbariÃ±o is a fragile style of white wine and some just don't age well. This is one of those wines; it's slightly past peak maturity, as evidenced by wheaty, yeasty aromas. The palate finishes with a hint of bitter citrus pith."
"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power."
"This is a rustic but likeable wine. It's dry, tannic and full-bodied, with good varietal flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak. Drink soon."
"From a very hot and difficult vintage, this Chianti Classico has unusual aromas of dill, thyme and toasted oak that carry over to the palate. It's already evolved with a short finish."
"The Cabernet Moravia grape is a cross between Cabernet Franc and Zweigelt. Here, it incorporates all of Cab Franc's leafy herbaceousness and Zweigelt's tart, cranberry flavors in a refreshing wine. It's delicate in concentration, but easy drinking, with lots of green, grassy notes on the finish."
"This meaty, oaky Sauvignon Blanc, with a trace of Semillon, is slightly bitter with grassy and lemony aromas and flavors coming to the fore."
"A common, country-style wine, rich in cherries, cola and spices, with lusty tannins. It's lush and simple, but will rise to the occasion with a cheeseburger. The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Graciano."
"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture. Along the way, you'll encounter tar and rubber aromas in front of flavors such as carob, vanilla and stewed berry fruits. A minty, oaky finish is the final weighty act."
"Earthy with hints of roasted nuts and dried herb, this is a uniquely savory Sauvignon that would pair well with herb-accented fowl and fish. The palate is round and rich, but balanced with brisk lime acidity and a characteristic grassiness on the finish."
"This deeply saturated wine opens with a nice balance of ripe, chewy fruit, vanilla and spice. The wine promises to evolve over time, giving more space to the mineral nuances you can already detect now. Tones of licorice, black spice and clove are lively and intense in the mouth."
"An atypically light, delicate style of Riesling for the Pfalz, with lime and floral notes on the nose and a filigreed interplay of residual sugar and lithe acidity that lingers on the finish."
"Pian delle Vigne's 2004 Brunello is worlds apart from the scorching hot 2003 vintageâ€”so different, in fact, the wine seems utterly reborn. You can smell those hallmark Sangiovese aromas: cherry, blue flower and wet earth, and taste the variety's elegant acidity."
"Bold and modern, Fonterutoli delivers the goods year after year. The wine is rich and plush with deep concentration and excellent intensity. You'll get aromas of bright cherry and some spice but what makes the wine stand apart is the clarity and purity of its aromas."
"Very ripe and extracted, just oozing the flavors of melted blackberry jam, black raspberry purÃ©e and milk chocolate. A bit sweet, but saved by firm tannins."
"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion. There is more stuffing, especially apparent in the nose and also in the mouth, than in the winery's varietal blends. The back end of the wine suggests bread and chocolate, light hints of toasted almond and cinnamon spice."
"Verging on orange in color, this intensely botrytized wine from one of Germany's unique grape varieties is thick, almost chewy with extract and sugar. Dried apricot aromas lead into orange marmalade flavors with an almost burnt, caramelized quality. Finishes long, with a hint of bitterness that helps balance some of the intense sweetness."
"Aromas of peach, lime and mineral make a first-rate initial impression, and are then followed by zesty citrus flavors that enhance rather than overpower the briny minerality. It's 13% alcohol, but maintains a wonderful balance of alcohol, acid and just a hint of sugar. Long and mouthwatering on the finish."
"Compared to Highlands' regular Cab, this is a great example of sometimes, more is less. The '06 Reserve is a gigantic wine, both in ripely extracted currants and in the taste of new, smoky oak. But it's very size makes it ponderous. The question is one of ageability. It could well be a sleeper. Try beyond 2010."
"The nose has a ripe plum and savory spice character in this sophisticated red. On the palate, cedar, mocha and pepper give it a rich, brooding quality. Tannins are fine but ageable. The finish is lingering and spicy. Pair now with richer meat dishes; give it a few years to age and it will be even better."
"This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years."
"Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices. This Syrah, from one of Napa Valley's best mountain regions, is dry and thick in refined tannins. But it's so rich in black currants, black cherries, chocolate, pepper and sweet, smoky oak that it's delicious now."
"Liquid smoke, brimstone, tar, asphalt, licorice and mesquite follow dense aromas of black cherry, dried currants and mature plums. The wine is on the ripe, chewy side but ultimately finds balance thanks to its naturally firm tannins and fruity freshness."
"Ripe, elegant wine, balancing fresh currant and red plum fruits against a mineral, dry structure. The acidity, the pure fruits and the solid tannins all work harmoniously together."
"This is a vibrant and fresh Brunello that offers a thick layer of plush fruit backed by shadings of spice, leather and cola. The mouthfeel is succulent and chewy and the tannins give the wine dimension and backbone. Drink now through 2015."
"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two."
"One sniff announces a wood pile's worth of toasty, dusty oak. But there's all the bold Tempranillo fruit and classic RDD terroir here to absorb it. Ripe as can be on the palate, with equal parts mulled black fruit, spice and mocha. It finishes smooth, with generous extract but nothing grating or grabby. Drink now through 2012."
"This broad, mouthfilling dry Riesling features powerful flavors of baked apple and dried spices, uplifted and amplified by oily, minerally accents. It's just a touch off-dry, balanced on the finish by crisp acids and pronounced minerality."
"The relatively low residual sugar in this wine gives it a leaner feel than Mosbacher's other 2007s, but the fruit comes through as lime, grapefruit and passion fruit, marked by Forst's prominent minerality. Very crisp and long; would pair well with many seafood dishes."
"From a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5â€“6 years. Subtle vanilla and bacon shadings upfront add nuance to the melon and pear aromas. Flavors are of soft, fully ripe tree fruit and melon, but held in check by citrusy notes and crisp acids."
"This is a great Chianti Classico Riserva that offers everything you look for in a wine from Tuscany. There's freshness and pristine cherry aromas along with spice, black mineral and fresh acidity on the close. The wine is approachable, soft and ultimately very food-friendly."
"One thing we've discovered about Tenuta La Fuga is that it performs evenly, year after year, despite climatic variations and extremes. That's a telltale sign of good winemaking and this Brunello delivers a sure bet to consumers thanks to its soft, supple mouthfeel and lingering aromas of succulent cherry and spice."
"Enzo Tiezzi has perfected his classic, traditional Brunello and delivers a tonic and fresh wine that would pair magically with hearty meat or pasta dishes that need to be broken down with extra acidity. On the nose, it shows aromas of sweet spice, almond, vanilla, caramel and wild berries."
"Ripe, fruity and delicious. Flatters with deep, long flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis and cedar, with a lush, tannic mouthfeel and long finish. Nice now, and should develop beyond 2012."
"This modern vineyard-designate Riserva offers toasted notes of spice, nut and crÃ¨me caramel. There are fruit notes in there too that are surrounded by mineral and earthy shadings. The mouthfeel is gritty, firm and persistent."
"Franco Pacenti makes excellent use of wood, resulting in a Brunello that shows fine balance between fruit and spice. The wine exhibits a slightly brownish hue but brings bright freshness and acidity to the table. Pair it with pasta or cheese risotto."
"Made 50/50 from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvigon, this dry, orange-pink-colored wine has an appreciable amount of tannin as well as plenty of fruit. Acidity and ripe raspberries show strongly, as well as crisp final acidity. Drink now."
"This wine has ripe red fruit flavors, a dry core, balanced tannins and plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now. The Maurin family's organic vineyards have all permitted grapes in Bordeaux, which is a good thing In a difficult vintage. This blend is Merlot (60%), CarmenÃ¨re (15%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Malbec (10%)."
"This wine is structured although it does have plenty of ripe and full of berry fruits. Drink from 2017. The blend includes 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc."
"This wine is light and fruity, well balanced with plenty of red berry flavors and only light tannins. It will be fresh and ready to drink from late 2016. The 30-acre vineyard on one of the appellation's highest spots was bought in 2009 by Denis Durantou, the owner of ChÃ¢teau l'Ã‰glise Clinet in Pomerol."
"With plenty of weight to support the ripe fruits, this is a balanced, perfumed wine. It has structure and tannins, along with fresh black currant flavors in the 80/20 Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon blend. Drink from 2016."
"This soft, gentle sparkling wine is fresh with raspberry fruits and acidity at the end. Drink as an apÃ©ritif."
"Lemon and herb aromas suggest a lean, crisp wine but the flavors are fairly ripe and the texture is rich and soft. Appley, floral and not at all tart, this is pleasant to sip."
Light aromas of passion fruit and grapefruit are followed by tropical flavors that linger. It's an easy drinking quaffer.
"Vivid plum and prune aromas and flavors define this generous and rather soft-textured wine. The fruit component is so rich it's jammy, and the tannins are very mild. The overall effect is grapy, almost sweet."
"This airy confection has aromas of lemon and vanilla, then almost sweet flavors of butterscotch and lemon cream on a fairly soft texture. It is light to medium bodied."
"Aromas of wet earth, leafy underbrush and dark berry lead the nose on this informal red. The simple palate is rather diluted but offers notes of dried black cherry, orange peel and nut alongside zesty acidity."
"Hints of dusty mineral, nut and spice lend a savory tone to apple and pear in this cutting, crisp Riesling. It's honed and steely on the palate, finishing on a reverberating and bitter lime-zest note."
"This blend is green and herbal up front. Following the nose, the palate is solid and chewy, but raw. Flavors of berry, olive and mixed spices are herbal, minty and green, while finishing notes of herbs, chocolate and heat fit the bill. This is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, with CarmenÃ¨re and Merlot."
"Attractive, simply fruity Chenin Blanc, this is a wine for drinking now. It is full of nutty flavors and apple acidity, with just a touch of minerality to give the wine some tension."
"Lighter in color and body than many counterparts, this wine presents a sour blackberry and woody herb nose. Black olives, elderberries, cedar and black pepper beef flavors show on the gravelly palate."
"Scratchy aromas of red fruits register as raw, with a note of animal hide. This feels racy and wild, but lively. Briny, rugged flavors of raspberry and plum finish tart, with a pickled note that won't let go."
"Reserved aromas of spice, pear and lychee are followed by medium-sweet flavors. Pair it with yellow curry."
"Earthy, woody aromas suggest oak, coconut and coffee, while an herbal, olive note is also present. This is a bit sharp and shearing in terms of acidity, but creamy vanilla flavors mellow the wine's racy plum and cherry character."
"Low in oak and high in acidity, this wine skews tart and high-strung in terms of citrus and wet stone-like notions, offering a bouquet of lemon chiffon. A nice entry and finish surround a less-intriguing middle."
"Jammy black-fruit aromas are woody, reduced and come across cheesy. A thick, tannic, oaky body is home to flavors of plastic, creamy oak, vanilla and charred berries. This is pasty, oaky and creamy on the finish."
"This doesn't taste true to the grape variety, but it's a good white wine with orange peel, jasmine and tangerine aromas, fairly quiet fruit flavors and then a floral, citrus finish. Light to medium bodied, it has an appetizing texture."
"Light aromas of herbs, woodspice, tire rubber and red fruit lead to jammy raspberry and spice flavors that provide easy drinking pleasure."
"Cola and berry aromas are jumpy. This feels tight and rubbery, but reasonably well focused. Standard plum and berry flavors are restrained, while the finish is fruity, with a clipped ending."
"Buoyantly aromatic, this blossomy Traminette sparkling wine stands out in a line up of traditional Champagne-style sparklers. Heady rose and gardenia tones feel perfumey on the palate, but brisk acidity and soft, pillowy foam are pleasant."
"A soft-textured, rather light-bodied and fruit-forward offering, this smells and tastes like pear, apple and grape juices with a touch of sweetness and low acidity."
Fresh red fruits are smoothed out with caramel and spice flavors that give a ripe feel to this wine. It's light and ready to drink.
"A rich texture and rather ripe fruit flavors make this softer and broader in taste than many of its peers. Flavors like Fuji apple and Bartlett pear are appealing, and the mouthfeel is smooth and easy rather than crisp."
"Fresh peach and light floral aromas lead to ripe, grapey flavors and a soft, soothing texture in this medium-bodied wine. It is smooth and low in acid, with a charming flowery element that helps it stand out."

"Fresh in zingy, ripe blackberry flavor, this well-made Zin has firm tannins and a dollop of peppery spice on the finish."
"This offers aromas of oak, chocolate and raisin. On the palate, black cherry and prune flavors are accompanied by bittersweet chocolate, vanilla and evident oak sensations. This is already evolved, so drink over the next year or two."
"Pencil eraser, iodine, latex and blueberry aromas settle better than they start. In the mouth, this is saturated and chunky in feel, with toasty flavors of blackberry, licorice and mint that finish long, herbal and loamy."
"Enticing and idiosyncratic on the nose, this Merlot offers notes of rose petal, smoke, blood orange and caraway seed. The palate is medium bodied and the 13% alcohol gives it a sense of finesse. Fine but firm tannins frame the cherry fruit, and it finishes with hints of maduro and rose."
"There's lots of rich Chardonnay character in this affordable wine. It's rich with vanilla, buttered toast, honey, orange and pineapple-jam flavors, with brisk acidity providing balance. Great price for a Chard this good."
"This Pinot starts out tight, but after some time in the glass opens up to reveal black raspberry, mushroom, cola and exotic spice notes. It's dry, yet silky, in the mouth. A pretty wine, and for the price, a comparative bargain."
"Impressive for its power, a wine of considerable interest and complexity. It's rich in black cherries, red currants, cola, bacon and spice flavors, but the texture really stands up, a combination of firm tannins and brilliant acidity. Oak provides complicating notes of sweet toast. Drink soon."
"Everything about this lighter-framed Navarran blend is an echo of when European red wines were racy and crisp as opposed to big, extracted, dark and woody. With fresh raspberry aromas, zesty acidity and earthy flavors of red berry and spice offset by cocoa and vanilla, this is akin to Bordeaux and it should go nicely with most kinds of food."
"Perfumed in cinnamon-flowery aromatics, this well-valued Zin is softly spiced, lush and smooth, drinkable with black cherry flavor and plenty of personality."
"This is the ideal anti-Chardonnay white wine. There's no oak at all to interfere with the lemon, lime and mineral flavors, and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. A dry, crisply brilliant wine to drink now with everything from sushi to tuna tartare."
"Full-bodied wine with ripe pear and red apple flavors, laced with delicate acidity. It's an elegant wine, a fine balance with a more mineral, tight texture as a counterpoint. Drink from 2014."
"A smooth and rounded wine, its ripe plum and blueberry flavors well integrated into the soft tannins and sweet acidity. Drinkable now, but worth waiting for two more years."
"Very dark, structured wine, with coffee as well as fruit flavors. The wood comes through firmly producing a solid, very dry character. The more juicy black currant fruits are still to show well. So wait to drink until 2015."
"This Amarone is loaded with big fruit sensations of ripe cherry and plum, along with raisin, chocolate and oak accents. It's rather one dimensional, but has delicious fruit and is perfect for immediate enjoyment."
"Intensely concentrated in black currants, cassis liqueur and oak aromas and flavors, this Cabernet is so strong, it's practically undrinkable now. It's not just the potent tannins and bright acidity, it's the raw, jammy quality of the fruit. All these elements could begin to come together after 2017."
"The small enclave of Buzet makes wines in a Bordeaux style, with black currant fruitiness and some firm tannins. This wine, now aging well, shows ripe juicy fruits, a solid dry core and refreshing, crisp acidity at the end."
"Very spicy in character, the wine has a rich feel to it, offering a rounded palate with a touch of mango alongside the more complex almond and spiced pear flavors."
"Spicy red currant fruit comes up quickly, backed with the grape's signature accents of stem and earth. There's a residual flavor of slightly bitter tomato leaf."
"This is the winery's Left-Bank-Bordeaux-style blend, three quarters Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a pleasing mix of red and black fruits, licorice, toast and smoke, and spent two and a half years in French oak, 60% new. The wine is quite tasty and drinking well, though the blend lacks focus."
"A rich wine, full of black fruits, ripe tannins and juicy acidity. It's powerful and structured, showing a mineral texture, bold acidity and ample fruitiness."
"This opens with funky but not unpleasant aromas that soon burn off to reveal earthy notes and mature black fruit. The palate shows a very ripeâ€”almost overripeâ€”blackberry flavor, with mushroom and tobacco leaf accents. While the ripe fruit still has immediate appeal, this is getting tired, so drink soon."
"Don't let the label mislead you; this is not a dessert wine. It's off-dry, with a pretty suite of lemon, orange and citrus peel flavors. A whiff of tea runs through the aromas, and a bit of lemon oil in the finish."
"A delicate, crisp, very pure wine. It has perfumes of white flowers, which continue with the addition of ripe pear and lime. Crisp at the end, for drinking now, but also keep until 2017."
"Smooth and soft, this is a warm wine, showing richness as well as a lightly rustic character that will disappear as the wine ages. It has fine tannins, layered with crisp acidity and a stalky, spicy texture. Drink now or keep until 2016."

"The top cuvÃ©e from Mercer Estates, this reserve is a Bordeaux-style blend based upon 64% Merlot, the rest a mix of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A firm entry introduces a solid mid-palate with a mix of black fruits, coffee and toast. The finish is clean and gentle, with moderate persistence."
"This offers aromas of mature black fruit and raisin. The palate delivers a vibrant black-cherry core, layered with accents of black pepper and Asian spice. It also has fresh acidity for the vintage, and will pair well with buttery dishes or cured meats."
"This young, stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay has a beery hoppiness to the aromas, leading into a tart, juicy and crisp palate of lime and grapefruit. The acids taste of wet stone, and that vivid minerality brings dimension and lift to the finish."
"This is an unfettered but very enjoyable Amarone, with upfront aromas of black fruit. The palate shows ripe but not exuberant plum and prune flavors, with a hint of chocolate. Pair with seasoned cheeses or braised meat dishes."
"This wine is abundant with aromas of cherry Coke, sarsaparilla and baking spice. The palate is delicate yet is given some weight from seven months in neutral French and American oak. This wine gains a soft texture from Tannat skins added during fermentation."
"This neon-watermelon sparkler shows playfully fruity aromas of watermelon hard candy and fresh strawberries. Ample acidity keeps the palate lively, with ripe watermelon, cherry and strawberry flavors carrying through to the bright finish."
"This is the lightest in a series of wines featuring the Avesso grape. Herbal, crisp and with plenty of acidity, it's also fruity and ready to drink."

"This wine comes from vineyards outside the boundaries of the DÃ£o region but has the same typical blend. It shows minerality as well as rich fruit and soft tannins. The wine is balanced, stylish and deliciously ready to drink."

"This ripe, full-bodied rosÃ© is made from 100% rich, perfumed Touriga Nacional. Good balance between ripe strawberry fruits and the crisp acidity make it both fruity and warm. Drink now."
"Made in the style of a southern RhÃ´ne blend (half Viognier and one quarter each Marsanne and Roussanne), this is lightly lemony, with a bit more fat in the middle. None of the three grapes overpowers the others, but the flavors feel a bit generic. Though fermented in stainless steel, it's gold in color and shows some hints of toast."
"This medium-bodied wine features a heavy dose of baking spices and vanilla layered atop notions of earth and red cherries. It's a little dry and woody, but cinnamon and clove notes add charm."

"Based in Burgundy, this producer understands Chardonnay. That's why this wine is so finely balanced, with a ripe and perfumed character and a warm, full aftertaste. Drink now."

"Heavy and soft, this is lacking in structure and vitality. It has some ripe flavors of blackberries, currants and spice. Drink up."

"Rich and substantial, this is potent in blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors. High alcohol gives it a hot mouthfeel. It's not really representative of the Arrowood name of old."
"Dark and inky, this natural wine is made from organic fruit, and it offers aromas of cured beef and prune, followed by accents of tobacco and wet earth. There's not much fruit, and it shows slightly bitter tannins on the close."
"This tastes bone dry, with a caramel note that's followed by light, bright notes of red berry and apple. The finish is crisp and tight."

"Tart and dry, this has a broad flavor that does not express much varietal specificity, with some notes of caramel and butter. Not yet knit together, this could improve significantly with further bottle age."
"Leather, cheese, licorice, herb and tomato notes define the nose on this snappy, crisp Cabernet that's more racy and zesty than rich and deep. The finish is wiry, but overall the wine is short on richness."

"A big, heavy rosÃ©, this has an orange-pink color and slightly sweet flavors of jammy raspberry, vanilla and cream. A blend of Syrah and Grenache."
"The Dion is a new entry in the long list of Erath single-vineyard wines. It doesn't show much in this difficult vintage. Short and intensely herbal, it has strong scents and flavors of tomato leaf, which override any hint of ripe fruit flavor."
"It's difficult to understand what this is trying to be. Pinot Gris can show some light blush color, but this wine is almost pink. The result is tannic and tart, with a rhubarb-like flavor."
"This has surprisingly structured fruits and firm tannins for a Nouveau, and it still maintains a juicy cherry flavor and ripe acidity. The finish has a tangy, textured character."

The dense palate doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed plum, black pepper and tobacco alongside firm but velvety tannins. It finishes on a succulent note."

"This is the first vintage made by the vineyard owners in 25 years, a welcome return for one of the founding families of Oregon viticulture. Strawberries and raspberries, tart and spicy, anchor an elegant and interesting young wine. The finish continues clean and well-defined. Don't look for a blockbuster style; rather it's more delicate and refined."

The savory palate offers layers of crushed wild cherry, red raspberry, white pepper and clove alongside supple tannins. Succulent and easy drinking, it should be enjoyed through 2016 to capture fresh fruit."

"Underbrush, forest floor, crushed violet, new leather, mature plum and graphite aromas lead the nose on this brawny red. The hearty palate delivers dried black cherry, blackberry, nutmeg, grilled sage and licorice alongside youthfully aggressive but ripe tannins. Drink 2015â€“2025."

It's aromatically reserved, revealing fresh and dried herbs, green pepper, vanilla, cocoa and dark cherry. The dark fruit flavors show a very pretty combination of richness and restraint."
"You'd swear this 100% varietal wine had some Viognier in it, but the orange-peel aromas and flavors are just a hallmark of Yakima Valley fruit. It also features abundant cranberry, mulberry, rose hip and savory notes. The supple feel with light meat accents is where this wine really shines, showing purity, texture and a lot of elegance. Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere."
"Aged for 30 months in French and American oak (90% new), this wine brings pleasing notes of cafÃ© au lait, pencil lead, cashew and woodspice. Rich coffee and chocolate flavors are backed by a silky feel, with the wood playing prominent role."
"Like a lemon-cream pastry in a bottle, this low-yield, hillside-grown wine has buttery, creamy aromas, rich almond and bright lemon flavors and a soft, nearly sweet finish. Not too full-bodied, it's a bit lighter in texture than many, because of that fresh lemony acidity to buoy it up."
"This strikes a good balance between spicy oak, fruitiness and firm texture. It smells lightly spicy from oak barrels, and also fresh like red cherry and sweet plums. Rich and layered in feel, it finishes dry and full bodied. Not overblown, it has just the right mix of elements for the dinner table."
"This energized white wine has a German accent. Aromas recall honey, honeysuckle, tart apple and pineapple, and the flavors are like orange zestâ€”tart, crisp and slightly bitter in a good way. This blend of Kerner, GewÃ¼rztraminer, Riesling and Bacchus grapes should be brilliant with rich shellfish. It was barrel-fermented in 60% new oak, which one can't so much taste as feel subtly."
"Floral scents of rose and violet also convey red berry, Mediterranean scrub and peppermint camphor. The palate is still tightly wound but reveals crunchy red cherry, cinnamon, white pepper and anise alongside bracing tannins. Drink after 2018."
"The color of decades-aged Chardonnay, medium-to-dark straw, this dessert wine is rich in toasted almonds and hazelnuts, with secondary flavors of baked apple and stone fruit. Mouthfillingly rich, it remains balanced and complex, lingering on the finish in baking spices."
"From vines owned by ChÃ¢teau Giscours but outside the Margaux appellation, this ripe and structured wine is a great success. Its rich berry and black currant fruits are pushed forward by the firm tannins that are so perfectly judged. It's a wine to enjoy soon, so drink from 2017."
"This very complete wine offers dark tannins, ripe berry fruits and a velvet texture. It's rich, relying on blackberry and black plum flavors and a dense structure. Mouth-filling, it delivers delicious fragrant acidity at the end. Drink from 2017."
"From the northern end of the Haut-MÃ©doc region, close to Saint-EstÃ¨phe, this dark-hued wine is still very structured. Smoky wood-aging flavors give complexity that balances the ripe black currant fruitiness. It's still developing, so don't drink before 2018."
"Big structure underlies this wine, very firm and dark. It has layers of dry tannins, big fruit and concentrated structure. The dryness at the heart of the wine will allow it to age well with its powerful structure and juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2020."
"Big, firm tannins dominate this structured wine. New wood aging shows, giving a very dry feeling. It's also rich and full in the mouth, packed with ripe black plum and berry flavors. It's going to balance well and richly. Drink from 2018."
"New wood shows strongly in this perfumed, Merlot-dominated wine. It is structured and still very tight and tannic at this stage. The chalk soil of the vineyard has given a strongly mineral character to the wine. That, along with the tannins, gives powerful support to the black currant fruits. Drink from 2018."
"The small area of Pez is one of the top sites in Saint-EstÃ¨phe, with many highly rated chateaus. This is one. New wood aging shows strongly at this stage, although so does the fruit. That gives a structured wine, firm and also full of blackberry fruit flavors. The future is good for this wine, so drink from 2018."
"Aromas of stewed fruit, prune and hay lead the nose on this brawny wine. The savory but monolithic palate offers dried cherry, fig, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. Drink through 2018."
"Intense, nutty, yeasty aromas are briny and a touch creamy. This has a tight, pure, round palate with salty nectarine, apricot and nut flavors. Walnut oil and white pepper notes grace a direct, lively finish."
"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are a touch briny. This is lively in the mouth, with lasting acidity that offers kick to an aged Rioja. Spicy notes of pepper sit on top of base-level cherry and plum fruit, while toast and spice flavors along with lasting acidity drive the finish."
"Rich in flavor and texture, this smells like white peach and buttered popcorn with a hint of chalky earthiness. The taste is creamy and reminiscent of honey and toasted almonds. It is medium bodied, but lush and almost thick in mouthfeel, with flavors that linger on the finish."
"Deftly calibrating sultry black fruit against savory earth tones, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc offers refinement. Toast, smoke and bramble integrate amid black plum and cherry flavors. The finish is powerful and persistent, fringed with finely grained tannins."
"Aromatic and elegant, generous and supple, this tastes rich while feeling polished and complete. An enticing, light aroma of oaky spice and raspberry mixes with tasty red cherry and black currant flavors on the palate. It is medium bodied, smooth in texture, and has a mild finish."
"Coming from one of the appellation's most consistent producers, this offers a tight, restrained nose of blackberry and licorice. It's also tight and bright on the palate, with refreshing flavors of black cherries and crushed rocks. An expert balance of tannins and acidity gives the mouth a clean wash."
"Extra dark in color, this has equally attention-getting dark chocolate and espresso aromas, rich black currant and blackberry flavors, and a firm, generously tannic texture. Although tempting to drink now, this will improve in complexity and smoothness through 2017."
"This vineyard near the confluence of the Salinas and Carmel valleys is producing strong wines, in this case one offering aromas of roasted game, smoked blueberries and cracked slate. It's juicy but not jammy on the palate, showing a pleasant, bright blend of blackberry and cherry fruits."
"Seamless and soft, this medium-built expression of clove, tobacco and dark red plum offers integrated tannins and a punch of oak, before settling into a whispered finish."
"A fairly dark and dense nose of boysenberry and smashed graphite entertain the nose on this blend of 50% Syrah, 45% Grenache and 5% MourvÃ¨dre, which is named after San Jose-based winemaker Adam Comartin's daughter. The palate is very iron-driven and minerally, with more boysenberry fruit and some concentrated violets giving nuance."
"From a 10-acre site called Scopus farmed by Ulises Valdez, this wine is rich and golden in color, given time to barrel-ferment and develop layers of fulsome complexity. Oaky, it has weight and depth, veering into ripe tropical notes and vanilla as it develops in the glass."
"Blackberries, violet and black-slate aromas mix with a bit of soy sauce on this blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% MourvÃ¨dre and 18% Grenache, grown in what today is known as the San Miguel District of Paso Robles. Juicy flavors of black raspberry and licorice combine for an easy-quaffing palate."
"This moderately aromatic wine offers notes of pear, citrus and apricot. It drinks medium sweet with stone-fruit and citrus flavors along with spritely acidity, bringing a whole lot of appeal."
"Cocoa, toast, vanilla, cigar box, coconut and raspberry aromas lead the way on this 100% varietal wine. The palate is full of dark fruit flavors with slightly gritty tannins and tart acids. Give it some time to come together."
"Syrah (51%) makes up most of this wine with the balance Merlot (35%), Cabernet Sauvignon (10%), Malbec (2%) and Petit Verdot. Vanilla, baking spice and plum aromas are followed by sweet blue-fruit flavors that go down easy."
The aromas of lime leaf and peach are bright and appealing. It drinks medium sweet with a finish that lingers.
"This Cabernet Franc (70%) and Merlot blend brings aromas of green herbs, dark chocolate, flowers and a mixture of red and black fruit. It's soft in feel with polished fruit and barrel flavors that linger."
"A blend of 50% Sauvignon Blanc, 40% Feteasca Alba (a native Romanian variety) and 10% Riesling Italico, this medium-straw colored wine has a bouquet of lemon skin with a hint of licorice. The flavor profile is dominated by lemon with soft spice notes."
"Aromas of cherry and currant are a bit flat. On the palate, this is perfectly good but common. Blackberry, plum and a dusting of chocolate are the key flavors, while this runs long and loamy on the finish."
"The aromas offer barrel spices, toast, black licorice and red fruit while the palate brings dark fruit flavors with a grainy feel. The oak (100% new French) juts out a bit and overrides the fruit."
"The Nashville-based R.S. Lipman Company, formerly just a Tennessee distributor, comes west for this deal of a wine, with lime blossoms, pink grapefruit and Gala apple slices on the nose. The palate is clean, crisp and rounded with lime spritzer and green-apple flavors."
"Lots of apple tones, some rounded, some tart, are coralled into a core of bright, lemony freshness on this simple, refreshing and dry Riesling. This is a lovely, easy and versatile wine with enlivening spikes of acidity."
"Rounded, almost luscious fruitiness is at the core of this easy wine. Lychee, lemon, peach and apricot scented with rose petals on a rich palate close with orange peel freshness."
"This wine is fresh, perfumed with a juicy red-fruit character. It offers red cherries, with a soft texture and acidity. The great fruitiness leads to a bright, crisp aftertaste."
"A strong blast of oak and wood shavings are up front and on top of the nose on this chunky Cabernet. Baked, herbal flavors of cassis and raspberry are toasty, slightly green and minty. Flavors of herbs and carob rest heavily on a plump, warm finish."
"This opens with herbal berry aromas that are textbook CarmenÃ¨re, but with airing a floral note comes in to accent black-cherry aromas. Toasty, herbal berry flavors are fruity and solid, while this shows some bitterness on the finish."
"A blend of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon with 21% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Malbec and 3% Syrah, the Frog Prince offers juicy blackberry and cherry around dusty, softened tannins and oak. Approachable now, it finishes awash in dried herb."
"Aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine and stone fruit lead the nose on this vibrant wine. The juicy palate delivers creamy white peach, green apple and honeydew melon alongside crisp acidity."
"Made with dried Verduzzo and Riesling grapes, this sweet wine offers aromas of ripe apricot, baked apple and pressed flower. The palate delivers dried orchard fruit, orange zest and vanilla. It ends on a note of acacia honey."
"A fairly uncommon grape for the entire Central Coast, this bottling offers squeezed blueberry and dark purple fruit aromas bolstered by black pepper and black rocks. Lighter in body than expected upon the sip, the palate shows cola, bright cranberry juice and a sandalwood spice that makes it very easy to drink."
"Sunny, peachy sweetness abounds in this light-footed Riesling. Off dry in style, it's breathlessly fresh and fruity, yet intensified by shimmering lime and mineral tones. Drink now for its youthful effervescence."
Ripe pear on nose and palate is the central theme on this broad-shouldered and richly textured wine. A dollop of sweetness is countered with fresh lime acidity that concludes in ripe accord.
"This wine made from an indigenous Romanian grape has a bouquet of red raspberry, tart cherry, and clove with a touch of brambles. Flavors of cassis, cherry vanilla, red plum and raspberry work their way across the palate, concluding in an agreeably spicy finish."
"Aromas of cocoa, spice, vanilla and dark fruit lead, with the oak (20% new French and American) playing a significant role. The blue-fruit flavors are plump in feel, narrowing toward the finish."
"A dense thicket of dark chocolate is prominent in this wine, alongside black raspberry and blackberry. Dried herb and pencil shavings also make their way through midpalate, atop a soft, approachable texture and full body."
"Initially, this CarmenÃ¨re smells green and minty, with a heavy herbal blast. Airing settles things down in front of a fresh palate with thorough body and build. Oak and salted-meat flavors with black fruits finish woody, toasty and herbal."
"A tight nose of boysenberry and pepper shows on this wine from a boutique, artistically labeled SoCal wine project by Ian Sergy and Zach Jarosz. The palate is light and texturally intriguing, with flavors of squeezed berries and crushed oregano, showing bright energy on the sip."
"Purple fruit aromas of blueberry, blackberry and boysenberry are given complexity with Indian spice, hot asphalt and beef char on the nose of this blend of 88% Syrah and 12% Grenache. The palate is full of crushed herbs, from oregano to thyme to marjoram, with just a tiny shred of cranberry fruit and lots of pine sap and even bell pepper."
"Sunflower-gold in color, this heady, hedonistic Chardonnay brims with aromas of toasted brioche, lemon and herb. Bright and completely balanced, it invites sip after sip until there simply is no more. Concentrated and complex it finishes dry, lingering in beautiful layers on the tongue."
"Artadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring. This is huge in the mouth, with lemony oak and broad tannins that don't grind. Intense blackberry, coffee, toast and smoky flavors finish a mile deep, with all sorts of textural grab and character. Best from 2016 through 2026."
"This structured wine opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, leather, cedar, bright berries and baking spices. The vibrant palate displays classic Nebbiolo flavors of crushed dark cherry, clove, cinnamon, truffle, sage, thyme and licorice alongside brisk acidity and bracing but noble tannins. It will bloom into a beauty. Drink 2020â€“2040."
"Scents of woodland berries, violets, dried rose petals, baking spices and Mediterranean herbs emerge from this wine. Crushed Morello cherry, graphite, red raspberry and white pepper all come seamlessly together on the palate alongside invigorating energy and intensity. It shows fantastic aging potential. Drink 2020â€“2040."
"Aromas of Mediterranean herbs, hay, leather and red berry come together in this structured Barolo. Loaded with energy and intensity, it delivers creamy cherry-berry flavors layered with white pepper, clove, nutmeg and orange zest. It already has depth but needs time to develop complexity. Drink after 2022."
"It offers classic Nebbiolo scents of red berry, forest floor, violet, baking spices, leather and Mediterranean herbs. The juicy palate doles out bright red cherry, mint, sage and black pepper alongside firm but velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2016â€“2024."
"Sourced from the best barrels made at the winery in 2013, this off-dry reserve checks in with roughly 30 g/L residual sugar, and plenty of acidity to more than balance it out. It's sweet, tart and sappy, with concentrated, juicy flavors of Meyer lemon, grapefruit and tangerine. It feels full-bodied and roundly fruity, then continues to extend itself with concentrated details of mineral and acid. A wine of exceptional power and length."
"Aromas of red rose, wild cherry, forest floor and a whiff of leather take center stage. The palate expresses ripe black cherry accented by vanilla, cinnamon, cocoa, clove, white pepper, balsamic herbs and subtle oak alongside firm tannins. It's already delicious, but give it time to develop. Drink after 2020."
"Fresh in mouthwatering minerality, this is positively bright, balanced and layered in lingering notes of lemon curd, green apple and just-picked vanilla bean. It is a gloriously delicate wine that's named for one of Marimar's beloved Springer Spaniels, made from one block planted to a selection of the See clone."
"Juicy red and black cherry, crushed raspberry, violet, white pepper, cinnamon and sage sensations all come together. Assertive tannins and exhilarating acidity balance out the intense fruit and spice flavors. It's still austere and tight but displays great breeding and serious aging potential. Drink after 2020."
"A perplexing wine to evaluate, the 2010 RunRig (97% Shiraz and 3% Viognier) evolves rapidly once poured, going from slightly stewed and overoaked to a wine that shows considerable class within 20 minutes or so. Aromas and flavors of brown sugar, mocha and roasted meat give way to raspberry compote, while the creamy texture and supple tannins conceal the wine's high alcohol level with ease."
"Black cherry, mint and white pepper aromas jump out of the glass along with a whiff of balsamic herbs. The intense palate boasts mouthwatering red cherry and strawberry flavors restrained by black pepper, cinnamon, clove, orange zest and a hint of eucalyptus. It's already gorgeous but it will develop even more complexity. Drink 2020â€“2030."
"It reveals aromas of rose, tilled earth, and smoky mineral. The bright palate doles out crushed red cherry and black raspberry accented with herbs, white pepper and clove. Juicy flavors are balanced by vibrant energy and polished tannins. Drink 2018â€“2038."
"This concentrated Barolo opens with aromas of violet, plum, subtle oak and menthol. The dense palate delivers crushed black cherry and raspberry layered with milk chocolate, coffee, clove and white pepper alongside fresh acidity and bracing tannins. Drink 2018â€“2038."
"This vibrant wine opens with intense aromas of rose, violet, ripe berries, pastry cream and a whiff of leather. The savory palate offers juicy black raspberry and tart red cherry accented with notes of mint, thyme and mineral alongside round tannins and fresh acidity. Drink after 2018."
"Intense and elegant, it brings together sensations of violet, crushed red berry, mineral and cake spices that are supported by firm but fine tannins and brisk acidity. Fermented with wild yeasts, it illustrates the vibrant character of the vintage. Drink 2018â€“2040. Acid Inc Selections, Stefano Miretti Imports."
"Bold and savory, it delivers black cherry, violet, and baking spice aromas with a whiff of espresso. The palate is still a bit austere, but offers up juicy black cherry, raspberry, sage and licorice alongside solid, assertive tannins. Don't even attempt this before 2020, but it will blossom into a beauty."
"Structured and powerful, it features aromas of underbrush, leather, spice, plum cake and subtle oak. The concentrated palate delivers juicy black cherry and red raspberry accented with notes of espresso alongside tightly packed tannins and fresh acidity. Give it time to unwind. Drink after 2020."
"Aromas of wild cherry, leather and truffle are quintessential Barolo. On the palate, rich black cherry, raspberry, vanilla, cocoa, balsamic herbs, sage and black pepper all come together supported by brooding tannins and brisk acidity. Best after 2020."
"Aromas of blackberry, violet and a whiff of dark spice lead the nose while the juicy palate serves up raspberry, black cherry, clove and white pepper. It's fresh and lively, with firm but approachable tannins."
"Fruit comes from three places for this wine, Bennett Valley, Alexander Valley and Knights Valley, exhibiting some good blending skill in the cellar. Red currant, clove, cedar and pencil all appear around a full-bodied, leathery texture and dots of black pepper and sage."
"Only very slight citrus notes appear on the nose. The palate opens into soft fruitiness with slight hints of apricot and peach. The chief attraction, though, is a central, vivid theme of white pepper. This is light bodied but full of subtle charms."
"Hints of white blossom mix with faint notes of pear to create a delicately balanced, fresh and spring-like wine that is as light as gossamer. This has verve and freshness, tender, blossomy aromatics and immense charm. Drink as soon as possible while its elderflower notes shimmer lastingly."
"The producer travels to Stagecoach Vineyard on Atlas Peak to source 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Syrah and 7% Malbec, making for a softly layered wine with plenty of structure. Crisp red currant and plum dance around savory specks of cedar and toasty oak."
"Wiry cherry and herb aromas are fresh and reedy. This Rioja feels crisp and mildly astringent. Quick, punchy flavors of plum and wild berry fruits turn more oaky prior to a finish that's fresh and forward, with hard tannins. Drink through 2021."
"At this early stage, the oak is still prominent. Mocha and brown sugar mark the nose, the palate offers dark-roasted coffee bean notes and the finish seems rather dry and astringent. But dig deeper, and a core of cherry fruit comes into focus, fully ripened to silky tannins and just needing time to emerge. Drink 2018â€“2025."
"Yellow grapefruit pith, white Asian pear flesh, cherimoya and crisp stonefruit elements show on the nose of this bottling, which also offers the typical touch of petrol. The palate is very pithy and high-toned, showing lemon rind, sour orange and sour apple on the finish."
"Gritty, lightly stalky aromas of herbal blackberry smell a bit roasted and/or burnt. This is medium-full in body, with drying tannins. Roasted, tarry plum and berry flavors finish with peppery spice and heat."
"Peppery iron-oxide notes dance alongside notions of blueberry and cherry. The colour is dark but the fruit is crunchy and fresh. There is drive and vividness at the core of this rustic, appetizing red. Tannins are present and give a pleasant but light grip. Fresh acidity provides even more focus. With food this will shine. Drink soon to enjoy its vividness."
"Dried blueberry fruit, asphalt, black plums and chocolate sauce aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend by the RhÃ´ne specialist. Tart black fruit, tar, fudge and fresh purple flowers show on the palate, an always reliable intro to the popular Central Coast grape."
"Aromas of violet, dark-skinned berry and baking spice are the highlights. On the bright, juicy palate, soft velvety tannins frame mature black cherry, blackberry and a hint of cocoa."
"This organic wine, produced with a natural and biodynamic approach, is an interesting blend of 30% Syrah, 20% Grenache, 10% MourvÃ¨dre, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Malbec and 10% Marselan. It offers pronounced earthy characteristics, as well as a citrusy kick (like tangerine oil) to the blueberry and blackberry fruit core. The mouthfeel is creamy and velvety, with plush tannins and lingering baking-spice flavors."
"Nearly equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this dusty red also makes use of 26% Syrah, 3% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% unidentified as other. A straightforward wine, it's juicy in blackberry and chalky chocolate."
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of bluish-black fruit, exotic spice and a balsamic note. The firmly structured palate doles out blackberry, spiced blueberry, coffee and black pepper accompanied by assertive but fine-grained tannins."
"This is a medium-bodied, spicy rendering of Syrah. Cherries, herbs and spice all mingle easily, while the silky texture is its calling card. Drink nowâ€“2023."
"A very interesting wine, this is reserved but complex, not overtly fruity or buttery, but more intriguing than that. It smells lightly like lemon zest and hazelnuts, and tastes quietly concentrated, like peach skin and almonds."
"Grown inland, away from the sea's influence, this wine has a full-bodied character. Acidity cuts through the ripe red fruits and caramel and spice flavor. The wine is rich and full in the mouth, soft at the end."
"From a winery located below Bernal Heights in San Francisco, this wine offers rich aromas of thick, chewy Meyer lemon pith, lightly toasted sourdough bread, toasted almonds, struck match and the slightest hint of browned butter. The palate is intriguingly tart, oily in texture and quite powerful, with cooked lemon rinds, lemon creme brÃ»lÃ©e and marcona almond oil flavors."
"A saline edge offsets crisp yellow peach and starfruit flavors in this zesty dry Riesling. It's spry and fruity, yet elegant, finishing with surprising persistence."
"Made in a frankly commercial, off-dry style, this is dangerously quaffable. Pronounced apple, pear and melon flavors are balanced by moderate acidity and a hint of ginger on the finish. Drink now."
"Vivid pepper and rounded red plum notes are joined by hints of cinnamonâ€”reminiscent of freshly baked plum tart. This is a soft, pliable but very full-fruited wine. Lovers of Pinot should definitely try St. Laurentâ€”here it is in a very approacheble and supercharming, medium-bodied red."
"Apple and melon aromas are clean, stony and direct. This feels juicy while also offering ample body weight. Tangerine and nectarine flavors finish long, minerally and ripe, with none of AlbariÃ±o's common pithy bitterness."
"Stewy berry and melted chocolate aromas are ultra oaky and creamy. A tannic, heavy mouthfeel and borderline overripe flavors of prune, chocolate and tobacco finish raisiny and baked. Drink through 2020."
"A single vineyard expression from this winery's newish vineyard, this shows pressed purple flowers, deep blueberries and a touch of tar on the nose. The flavors are dense, dark and framed by strong tannins, with elderberry, pencil lead and deep lilac syrup gaining intrigue from white sage, white pepper and raw beef tones."
"Strapping currant and berry aromas come with a full dosage of toasty oak. This Malbec feels sinewy, with good depth. Oaky notes of toast and blackened spice lend a chocolaty essence to berry and plum flavors, while this finishes with an herbal, spicy aftertaste."
"Lots of fresh apple flavors, a crisp balance and smooth mouthfeel make this light-bodied wine refreshing and fun to drink. It has some richness on the midpalate and finish, but basically keeps its lively, tangy personality going."
"Sharp aromas of peach blossoms, honeyed nuts and lemon balm make for a fruity yet biting nose on this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc from Happy Canyon and 42% Viognier from San Luis Obispo County. Ripened stonefruit flavors are cut with a sizzle of acidity and warmth of sea salt and candied Meyer lemon on the palate."
"A clear, light-bodied wine that's slightly reduced on the nose, this Spring Mountain site provides a tightness of black tea and cherry cola, with a leanness that's hard to miss. Leather, currant and baked bread add additional complexity and intrigue."
"A 100% varietal wine entirely from Yountville, this presents a touch of herb and cedar on the entry aromatically, followed by a thickness of tannin that softens in the glass. Big-boned, it finishes strong in tobacco and coffee."
"Simultaneously light yet earthy, this shows cherry pie, concentrated pomegranate, whole nutmeg, buttery crust and intriguing brown spices on the nose. There is a bit less action on the palate, but still plenty of tart cherries, tobacco and brown spice elements."
"Blueberry, grapeseed, leather, cigar box and concentrated lavender combine for an elegantly intriguing nose on this bottling from a winery between Morgan Hill and Gilroy. The palate is fresh and rather light, with plums, figs, crushed peppercorns and a forest floor/pine needle intrigue."
"Fresh and tempting, this has a hot-pink color and flavors like watermelon and cherry. With medium body and even a light touch of tannin, it's more meaty than many rosÃ©s, so you can serve it with the meal as well as for an apÃ©ritif."
"Sanguine in cedar, pencil lead and tea, this wine's elegant opening gives way to ripe black fruit and thick, burly tannins. The finish is marked in vanilla oak and a taste of cigar."
"This is a bold, assertive Sauvignon Blanc, boasting bright citrus aromas and flavors, lifted by just a sprinkling of cut grass. A bit of creaminess adds dimension on the palate, which then finishes on a burst of lime and grapefruit."
"Lightly smoked stone fruit and apple blossoms greet the nose on this bottling of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc. The palate is much more interesting, with lemon sorbet and ripe apples clinging to a steely centerline that shows flashes of flint and gunmetal."
"Aromas of ripe berry, Mediterranean herb, menthol and eucalyptus lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate is already somewhat evolved offering blackberry extract, mature black cherry, licorice, spice and espresso alongside polished tannins. It closes on a note of bitter walnut."
"This long-aged blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Petite Sirah is plump on the oaky nose with condensed rose petal, chocolate cake and violet aromas. The palate starts with ripe black cherries but then settles into an asphalt-laden midpalate, finishing with chocolate-chip cookies and a graphite tension."
"Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet. Tart lime and lemon verbena pop on the palate as does melon pith, with a slight herbal character on the finish."
"There is a high-toned aspect to the otherwise neutral nose that just gives away lemony hints. The palate is sprightly and fresh and reveals a very creamy, fruity, almost tropical core which is cut very pleasantly by fresh, aromatic lemonâ€”this is Chardonnay but not as you know it. A very fruity, rich but fresh number."
"This wine could be labeled a Cabernet Sauvignon, which makes up 83% of the blend, with the rest Merlot. The aromas of fruit leather, dried blackberry, black licorice and medicine cabinet are bright, though they seem considerably more evolved than the wine's age might indicate. The black-fruit flavors display a sense of balance that carries through the finish. Drink now."
"Already six years old, this wine offers aromas of black licorice, dried cherry, vanilla, clove and abundant wood spices. The flavors of black fruit, licorice and barrel spice intertwine and carry through the finish. The wood is a bit out front at times but the wine still delivers a lot of enjoyment."
"Aromas of blue and purple fruit mix with notes of dried thyme and black pepper. The flavors are tart and elegant, showing a good sense of balance and restraint, with a finish that lingers."
"Half Cabernet with the rest Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, MourvÃ¨dre and Petit Verdot, this wine opens with aromas of sweet barrel spices followed by dried red and black fruit. The palate is fruit-forward and flavorful, bringing you back for another sip."
"Made with 80% Nasco and 20% Vermentino, this offers delicate aromas of marzipan, dried apricot and wildflower honey. On the sweet, full-bodied palate, notes of white almond back up acacia honey and tangerine zest."
"MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah each make up a third of this wine with the rest Grenache and Viognier. The latter (12%) shows itself prominently on the aromas, with perfumed notes of purple flowers and orange peel that are followed by purple fruit, vanilla, coffee and spice. The palate offers elegant, yet sweet and flavorful pomegranate and cranberry flavors with pleasing spice accents."
"Honeycomb, fig and herb aromas are followed by textured flavors that show intensity and persistence."
"This fragrant red opens with lovely scents of perfumed berry, blue flower and Oriental spice while the polished palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry, anise and clove. Fine-grained tannins give the finish grip."
"Vanilla, thyme, dill and plum aromas are followed by plentiful fruit and barrel flavors that possess a pleasing mouthfeel. The oak is out front at times, especially on the aromas, but the wine is appealing."
"A mountaintop vineyard in a cool year delivers the expected lighter elegance, offering a complicated and fascinating array of aromas, from incense and white pepper to patchouli and potpourri. The palate starts with sour cherries before the herbal lift of fennel and dill arrives, proving a light, curious and tasty wine."
"Merlot (55%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) make up the majority of this wine with the balance Malbec. Vanilla, barrel spice and dark-fruit aromas are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors that linger. The oak gets a bit out-front but the wine still has much to offer."
"Blue-fruit aromas intermingle with vanilla and other barrel spices. The coffee and plum flavors are full and supple in feel, followed by a tart finish. The wood seems a bit primary but the fruit and feel is still hard to ignore."
"Bright aromas of freshly roasted coffee beans, brown stems, dried herbs, purple flowers, mineral and black pepper are followed by ethereally light fruit and savory flavors that focus on elegance. This wine provides plenty of interest but the finish seems a bit clipped. It might lengthen out with aging."
"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this warm-vintage wine seems aromatically quiet, with light aromas of funk, earth, red berries and coffee. Flavors are generous and ripe, with the alcohol occasionally poking out."
"The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish."
"Les Collines and Stone Valley fruit make up 75% of this wine with the rest coming from Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Summit View. It offers generous aromas of blueberry puree, dried herbs, red fruit, woodspice, dried flowers and mineral. The flavors bring the same but are more pulled-back than the aromas suggest, with a bit of astringency that holds the wine back."
"Examples of this variety are rare in the state. Aromas pop with heaping amounts of fresh flowers and orange peel that are reminiscent of freesia in their intensity. The coffee and blue-fruit flavors are smooth and sultry, showing pleasing depth."
"Specks of rosemary give the aromatic entry of this wine a nice herbal invitation. This subtlety is followed by more bombastic waves of big, juicy black cherry, berry and oak. The tannins are still substantial, suggesting cellaring, through 2021."
"The gravel soil on this LÃ©vÃ¨que family property makes a great place to grow white grapes. A 50/50 blend of Sauvignon Blanc and SÃ©millon, this fresh wine suggests the ability to age. It is fruity now, hinting at apricots as well as citrus. It can be drunk now for its freshness, although wait until late 2016 for it to develop greater depths."
"Spice and ripe fruit, with attractive tannins and a soft texture. This wine is open, generous, rich and packed with black currant fruitiness. Give this wine another 2â€“4 years, but it could well be drinkable sooner."
"This is a crisp, but also rich style of Federspiel. It is full of ripe pear and apple flavor as well as a fine pinch of pepper. Acidity creeps in the background to balance this ready-to-drink wine. Screwcap."
"The most aromatically complex of the FE 2012 Rieslings, the Poison Hill offers beguiling scents of tangerine sherbet and Earl Grey tea. It's almost too perfumy for its soft, medium-bodied structure and slightly dusty-textured finish, but those floral elements are also its appeal. Drink nowâ€“2020+."
"This is a serious wine, despite the ripe fruitiness on its surface. It is full of peach and mango flavors, but structured by a cool, mineral feel. Tangy acidity and tight texture adds tension. It still needs to age 2â€“4 years. Screwcap."
"Exquisitely smoky and savory dried herb tones calibrate rich, tropical fruit aromas on this dry yet voluptuously textured Riesling. The palate is penetrating with minerality and a soft, elegant lemon-lime acidity. Finishes long and rich."
"Single vineyard, 100% varietal Malbec can be spot on, and this succeeds with a balanced flavor profile of mixed berries and earthy tannins. There's a hint of volatility, that quickly blows off. Decanting for an hour or so is advised."
"This traditionally styled Barolo has a classic fragrance of violet, rose and leather, with balsamic notes. The palate reveals ripe berry and spice with notes of pipe tobacco and while the acidity is tame the wine is massively tannic. Hold this for a few more years, but drink it before 2020."
"This shows enticing aromas of mint, spice and balsamic herbs and delivers a restrained palate of black cherry, with undertones of sage, white pepper, coffee and espresso. This is still aggressively tannic and needs time to soften."
"Rich cherry fruit anchors this excellent, estate-grown Merlot. It's lush and textural, with deep, dark fruit flavors and pleasant roasted notes of coffee and smoke. Half the barrels were new American oak, the rest French, mostly new."
"Made in a superripe, dense, almost fudge-like style, The Ripper tastes like a plummy, chocolaty Christmas cake with slightly coarse tannins on the finish. It's Port-like in flavor, but without the heat from elevated alcohol. Drink it over the next few years."
"Crisp, clean, mineral wine, with hints of a more aromatic character in the background, this is packed with apple and lemon flavors. A straight line of delicious acidity cuts like a knife through the wine. For aging over 3â€“5 years. Screwcap."
"This is a balanced and complex fifty-fifty blend, with herbal accents of licorice root, coffee bean and foliage that mingle harmoniously with ripe fruit notes of blackberry, wild raspberry and cherry. Medium weight and lushly textured, but not overdone, with a long finish that delivers light hints of mocha and pepper."
"Wet stone and earth notes add a distinct minerality to intensely fruity peach and apricot flavors on this ripe, but dainty Riesling. Zippy acidity and a flurry of fresh, green herbs make for a brisk finish."
"An easy-drinking introduction to Shiraz from Western Australia's Great Southern region, the 2010 Omrah offers gentle cherry and cedar notes accented by hints of chocolate and roasted meat. It's medium to full bodied, with a round, supple mouthfeel that ends in a wash of softly dusty tannins."
"Whiffs of slate and petrol add nuance to white flower and pineapple aromas on this intensely minerally, dry Riesling. The palate is lush and full with ripe nectarine flavor, freshened with a swathe of fresh green herbs on the finish."
"There's a lot to like in this effort: ample dark fruit, complex notions of tea leaves and dried grasses, and a richly textured, long finish. The wine is medium bodied and not very tannic, making it easy to sip repeatedly. Drink it over the next 8â€“10 years."
"Ripe, flashy fruit stars in this unoaked Chardonnay, in the form of pineapples, kiwis, limes and pears. The grapes for this delicious wine come from the winery's estate vineyard, in the cool southwestern pocket of the Russian River Valley."
"La Clarine Farm's rosÃ© is slightly cloudy, sourced mostly from Syrah grapes, with unusual additions of MourvÃ¨dre, SÃ©millon and Viognier. Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer says the Syrah grapes barely ripen and that's why he likes them for this wine. Light at 12.8% alcohol, it's an intriguing melange of earthy dark strawberry and mint, crisp in acidity."
"Oak, resin, vanilla and creamy aromas run side by side with cherry, cassis and berry scents on this blend of Cabernet, CarmenÃ¨re, Petit Verdot and Syrah. The palate is tight, juicy and textured, with good density. Flavors of creamy oak, mocha, raspberry and plum set up a medium-length, strong finish. Drink through 2017."
"This is a rich, robust Pinot Noir, defining the big, tannic style. It explodes in cherry, cola and pomegranate fruit flavors, with the added note of caramelized oak. You can drink this wine now, but it should hold in the bottle for 6â€“8 years, gradually mellowing. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, near Carneros."
This Cab wants a few more years to let its internal inconsistencies resolve. The primary cherry and blackberry fruit has faded and is turning nutty. But it's still pretty tannic. Needs to throw some sediment to let the inherent fruit emerge. Try after 2016.
"Earthy aromas include pencil eraser, wild herbs and eucalyptus along with tea and blackberry. This is very smooth and lush in the mouth, a reflection of a warm vintage. Flavors of olive, herbs, tobacco and black fruits are textbook for the variety, while a mellow, polished finish is silky and easygoing. Drink through 2016."
"This wine from the Santa Carolina family opens with ripe blackberry, prune and minerally aromas. It's rubbery and deep on the palate, with dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and bitter chocolate. A lightly herbal and spicy tasting finish with medium intensity fades away with lactic creaminess."
"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, this is a classic example of Wahluke Slope Syrah. Well-integrated layers of citrus, berry, roasted coffee beans, vanilla cookie and Graham cracker combine into a most accessible, yet complex wine. It's ready to drink, and should be consumed over the next 3â€“4 years."
"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style."
"Lots of muscle in this punchy Sauvignon Blanc, with its ripe lemon, lime, orange and papaya flavors, made bright by crisp acidity. Despite a streak of honey, the finish is dry. Additional richness is provided by barrel fermentation and the addition of a little SÃ©millon."
"This is a solid value in the world of Cabernet. Textbook notes of cassis and mint lead the way, framed by supple tannins and dressed up with hints of graham crackers and black tea. This is medium to full in weight, with a mouthwatering, velvety finish that belies its price point. Drink nowâ€“2020+."
"This is a blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Dineen, respectively. Though it falls on the lighter side for Washington Syrah, it's proportionate and pleasing, with strawberry fruit, mocha and toast. Tannins are fine and slender; though drinking well now, this could be cellared for awhile longer."
"Tantalizing spice notes mix with aromas of quince and lanolin on this fabulous bargain Riesling. While intensely tropical on the palate, it's remarkably nuanced with hints of potpourri, white flowers, and a sharp, steely acidity. Perfect as an aperitif, or paired with spicy, herbaceous Asian cuisine."
"With 12% SÃ©millon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc. Bracing and textural, with good varietal character but no excessive herbaceousness, it's loaded with fruit flavors of melon, grapefruit, kiwi and apple. A fine mix of precision and length."
"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness."
"A slightly earthy, spicy nose leads, followed up by good acidity and a touch of flowers. Pair with a cheese plate or enjoy on its own. Imported by Wine Emporium."
"Smooth and medium-bodied, with modest cherry scents and cassis and tobacco flavors. Soft and lacking energy on the finish, but clean."
"Lightly brambled and ever so slightly green, with pleasant strawberry and raspberry aromas. The mouthfeel is a touch choppy and grabby, but it's not too thin and rough to make it unpleasant. Not bad for the price."
"The wine's garnet ruby color is so saturated, it seems more like a light red than a rosato and the aromas recall raspberry, white almond, peppermint and a hint of Sherry."
"Creamy and fresh on the nose and followed by a play of good acidity and body, this Riesling from New Jersey is both supple and refreshing. The flavors fall a bit flat thoughâ€”and need more dimension."
"Harsh and hot, with chili pepper, mint and thinned-down blackberry and cherry flavors."
"You'll find sweet and sour flavors in this wine, like in a LifeSaver lemon candy. The best part is the acidity, which is tart, and keeps the wine balanced."
"Soft and sweet, with canned apricot and syrupy peach flavors."
"Sharp and green, with a minty, chlorophyll taste. High acidity makes the finish searing."
"Pride continues to struggle with this variety, as does everyone else in California who tries their hand at it. The '05 is semisweet and simple, with candied cherry-blackberry flavors that finish more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine."
"With 15.5% alcohol, this wine is too hot for balance. It also tastes unnecessarily sweet, with sugared raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors."
"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches."
"This is Pinot Gris without any particular varietal character; it could be almost anything. It's got tart, lemon-flavored fruit and a thin, watery finish."
"Barbecue is your best bet with this rustic Zin. It's lusty in jammy blackberry, mulberry and vanilla spice flavors that finish with a definite sugariness."
"Except for the sweetness, this is a pretty good wine. It has rich tannins, decent acidity, and ripe flavors of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. But that white sugary taste is off-putting in a table wine."
"A drink-now style of warming Shiraz, with plenty of weight and richness, soft tannins and flavors that artfully combine sour plum, cracked pepper, rare beef and chocolate. Drink it over the next few years."
"Desiderio, a legendary Italian Merlot, shows slightly sour aromas this vintage with cherry, pressed flowers, natural rubber and spice. It's a hearty, well-concentrated wine with loads of density and intense cherry fruit on the close."
"Although known in the Douro as an increasingly essential component of Port and table wines, the Touriga Nacional is equally at home in the DÃ£o. As here, it produces linear wines, very mineral, full of acidity with a perfumed elegance. This is a wine for aging over 4â€“5 years."
"Merlot (70%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot make for a smooth and rich wine with candied fruit, blueberry, spice and loads of sweet cherry. It's chewy and tight in the mouth, with polished, almost squeaky tannins and impressive length."
"Ripe, full-bodied white Graves, its flavors coming from tropical fruit, rich and complex. Good wood underscores the yellow fruit flavors and ripeness. Ready to drink, but could also age 2â€“3 years."
"Darkly tannic wine, packed with dryness. The result is firm at this stage, always likely to be full of tannins, but there is delicious fruit under this dryness."
"Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is packed with dusty tannins. Mint flavors show the wood aging while black currant boosts the fruit side of the wine. It is rich, its fruit very ripe yet also elegant."
"A wine that shows rich blackberry fruits, already rounded and soft. It has a tannic structure that is embedded in the fruit, along with spice, toast and a firm finish. An ageworthy wine."
"A solid Petite Sirah. You can use it in a wine education class as a textbook example of the variety. It's full bodied, tannic and rich in blackberry, blueberry, crÃ¨me de cassis, cola, grilled meat and black pepper flavors, enhanced by oak. Should age effortlessly, without gaining complexity, for many years."
"This pale salmon rosÃ© is a reliable sparkling wine at a very good price. The latest NV release is toasty on the nose, then offers just faint hints of peach or berry flavors. It's lithe yet creamy on the palate, with a long finish."
"Fresh berry, mint, cola and herb aromas make for a classic Maipo bouquet. Feels fresh and good, with plying tannins and bright acidity. Tastes earthy, mossy and herbal, with ample berry fruit. Licorice and prune flavors carry the finish. Syrah with Cabernet, CarmenÃ¨re and Petit Verdot."
"Each Jacob's Creek Reserve wine is now sourced from a specific region, and this Chardonnay shows solid improvement as a result. It's medium in body, with notes of grilled pineapple and sweet corn and a brisk, citrusy finish. Drink it over the next 6â€“9 months."
"You won't find many wines made with the Pugnitello grape (a native variety of Tuscany) and that's what is special about this bottle. The wine shows ripe fruit, blackberry and a soft, velvety texture."
"All black cherry and blueberry jam, this South Coast Syrah is fruity and spicy, full and fleshy with pepper and cinnamon spice and a teaspoon of black tea playfully showing through. Consistent throughout, a wine that's easy to like and complex at the same time. It spent close to two years in French oak, 30% of it new."
"A really good value in a California Chardonnay. Blended with a touch of Viognier to add brightness, and fermented in a little new oak, it hits just the right notes for today's popular taste. Slightly sweet in buttered toast and pineapple jam flavors, it's balanced with crisp acidity and a stony minerality."
"Il Bruciato (an expression of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and other varieties) shows pulpy fruit tones with ripe aromas of cherry, raspberry. leather and tobacco. The wine is smooth and soft with a spicy, fruity texture."
"Rose petal, mocha and a deeply concentrated red fruit palate make this a bold, beautifully constructed Pinot. Full bodied but nuanced with layers of dried herbs and florals, it finishes long with a soft layer of feathery tannins."
"As before, this is Weinbau vineyard fruit. The 2009 vintage seems to have presented some challenges, as the fruit flavors suggest uneven ripening, with a mix of tutti-fruity candy flavors along with some raisins. Tannins are smooth and there's a pleasing streak of graphite running through the finish. Drink soon."
"Broadly fruity, this dark and smooth Merlot is loaded with a luscious mix of black fruits. The flavors play out in forward, accessible fashion, flecked with a pleasing minerality."
"Spicy and bright, with an almost-too-ripe note to the fruit. Sweet ripe berries are joined by hints of sweet tomato and fecund, autumnal flavors, suggesting that this Syrah should be consumed sooner rather than later."
"A wild, herbal, wood-aged wine, its acidity a fine foil to the richly perfumed fruit. Pears and sweet melon come together with the toast of the wood. At this stage, the wood dominates and needs a year to softenâ€”then the result will be impressively food-friendly."
"The aroma shines with Syrah perfumes, while the palate brings together great ripe perfumed and spiced fruit, smooth, rich and dense. There is just an earthy element that needs to soften over the next two years."
"A wine that starts out all tannins. The fruit takes a while to show through and then produces juicy red cherry flavors and considerable acidity, the wood aging rounding the corners. This is for medium-term aging."
"Despite its youth, Moreccio (a blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon) really delivers the goods. Plush, soft and rich, it offers ripe concentration and mature aromas of spice, sweet cherry and blackberry. It's smooth, beautifully soft and caresses the palate."
"The wine has weight, is warm and spicy, with bold fruit flavors. A fine wine from Angludet, it is ripe, the wood judiciously balanced, finishing with tight acidity."
"Dominated by Merlot, this is a fruity and rich wine, rounded, ripe and spicy. It has density and weight, layered with dusty rich tannins. With its spice, blackberry acidity and chunky feel, it is already drinkable, but will age over several years."
"A wine from a chÃ¢teau that is still finding its form . It is soft, open, with attractive juicy red fruits and black currants, ready to drink soon."
"Big, dense wine, with dusty tannins and ripe red plum fruits. The wine is concentrated, fruity while also structured. It is already balanced, the acidity giving freshness, the texture showing the delicious ripe character of the vintage."
"Sweet, thick and plump, this Morellino Riserva shines. It shows thick layers of cherry, blackberry, leather and spice. Pair it with pasta shells stuffed with ricotta and spinach."
"Tageto shows a compact, elegant style with ripe cherry, cassis, rum cake and leather aromas. Sweet fruit and lively spice appear on the close."
"The nose of this wine leads with forward oak and vanilla aromas. The palate offers more personality and ripe, luscious fruit flavors, with additional notes of spice and toast. While it shows some complexity, it's fast approaching its optimum drinking window, so enjoy soon."
"As big as you expect a Howell Mountain Zin to be, offering rich, deep blackberry, currant, chocolate, licorice, bacon and cedar flavors that are sweet and dry at the same time. It's not just powerful in flavor, it's wonderful in structure, with refined tannins and balancing acidity. A minor criticism is some heat from alcohol, but that's the nature of ripe Zinfandel."
"Conflict is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc. Smoke wreathes around deep cherry candy flavors, leading into some chewy tannins dusted with savory herbs."
"This lush Chardonnay has a certain oiliness to the aromas, along with dusty, toasty components that ride through a soft, plush mid-palate. The fruit is a rich mix of peach and apricot, highlighted with toasted hazelnuts, vanilla and coconut."
"Dry spice is fighting with rich, smooth Chardonnay to give a wine that is unbalanced at the moment. It is full, fragrant, still young so the dried almond edge should melt into the more honeyed character. Drink from 2017."
"This is rich in black cherry flavors, with layered accents of white pepper, almond and walnut. It's the perfect marriage between the elegance of Valpolicella and the structure of Amarone. Imported by Panebianco, Vinity Wine Company."
"This sparkling wine is one of the best from Chandon in years. There's a soft refinement to the mousse, making it just as good as its more expensive rivals. Shows complex flavors of yeast, limes, oranges, vanilla and honey."
"This Cab Franc is rich and ripe in red and black currants and cherries, with a mocha sweet earthiness leading to sweet oak buttered cinnamon toast and a slight caramelization. It's dry and smooth in tannins. Best of all is an acidity and minerality that lend structure. Drink nowâ€“2015."
"Ripe, jammy black-fruit sensations dominate the nose and mouth of this wine, with lush, expressive notes of blackberry, black raspberry and boysenberry preserves. The texture is like crushed satin, with medium-plus yet fine tannins and a cocoa-kissed finish. Enjoyable now, but should develop additional complexities after 2016."
"Give this Cabernet high marks for sheer lusciousness. It's ripe in blackberries, black cherries and currants, with a veneer of sweet oak. Not a longterm ager, so drink over the next five years."
"This is a concentrated, firm and tannic wine. It has a structured feel from Chiroubles, which are the highest vineyards in Beaujolais. With its black fruits, dark tannins and concentrated texture, it could certainly age for 2â€“3 years, although it is ready to drink now."
"Showing some mature notes at the age of four years or so, with a mellow texture framing cherry pie, cola and spice flavors. Feels silky, lush and delightful. Drink nowâ€“2015 as the fruit gradually fades away."
"Blackberry and cassis aromas blend seamlessly with varietal scents of herbs and leaves. This Cab Franc feels crisp yet flush, with laudable structure and vital acidity. Flavors of leafy, spicy berry and plum finish with peppery notes, a jolt of salinity and heft."
"This is vibrant and expressive, with upfront purple-flower fragrances of violet and iris mixed with fruity tones of boysenberry and raspberry sauce. The crushed-silk texture offers medium tannins, ample acidity and skin-driven fruit flavors. Roasted coffee bean and sweet smoke accents mark the lingering finish."
"This is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot and 3% Syrah. It's toasty to the max, with scents and flavors of coffee and smoke as much as berry and cassis. There is great acid/tannin balance and some additional years of bottle age should help to bring out more of the fruit."
"Leaner and tighter than this bottling has been the previous few vintages, this wine is showing hard tannins obscure in plum, black cherry pie and mocha flavors. Yet it's a balanced wine, which should develop bottle complexity after 2016."
"L'Ecole tackles, with great success, two of the least-recognized strengths of Washington viticulture: SÃ©millon and Chenin Blanc. Here the blend includes 13% Sauvignon Blanc. It's well built, full bodied, with a mix of citrus and stone fruits, generous acidity, and some finishing skin flavors putting a slightly bitter frame around it."
"This wine is mostly SÃ©millon, with Sauvignon Blanc filling in the rest. It's one of the rare white wines from the Walla Walla AVA, graceful, full-bodied and tasting of fig and green banana. Just recently bottled, it still carries a bit of yeast in the nose and in the finish. Give it another few months to pull itself together."
"Coming from the Basque country, this blend of Cabernet Franc and Tannat is both perfumed and firmly structured. It is a solid wine, showing its wood aging while bringing out great ripe berry fruits. Drink from 2014."
"Inox is the winery's unoaked Chardonnay, the first of the vintage. This bottling provides a promising glimpse into the quality of the 2012s. It's so rich and ripe in citrus and tropical fruits, you won't miss the barrel influence. Try now with sushi, tuna tartare, or a salad of bitter greens, tropical fruits and feta cheese."
"A larger selection from Signal Ridge, Bravium's main bottling is still tiny production, light on its feet and aromatic in rose petal and violet. With notes of black cherry and pomegranate its tannins are silky and the wine deliciously priced."
"Givry is one of the unsung values in Burgundy. This ripe and structured wine shows why. It has weight, a firm texture and red plum and strawberry fruit flavors. All these elements are held together by a dark sense of tannin and fine acidity."
"Earthy, mildly leafy aromas of dried red fruits and vanilla are textbook for Rioja gran reserva. A medium-bodied palate shows balsamic richness along with flavors of prune, raisin, cassis and loamy earth. This is mild but solid on the finish, with a quick fade to the fruit component. Drink now."
"This muscular Amarone has an almost overripe fragrance, along with chocolate and vanilla notes. The alcohol is forward on the palate, but it also delivers sweet plum, prune and black pepper flavor, with hints of vanilla and coffee. This is direct and powerfully structured."
"his blend has a spicy character, balanced with acidity and a ripe, full honeyed character. On the dry side, it has richness, pepper and a deep texture that demands aging. Drink from 2017."
"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance of Merlot, Syrah and Malbec, is immediately accessible with notes of char, roasted coffee bean and cherry. The palate is rich, chocolaty and seamlessly stitched together."
"A complex wine, full of tight textures, apple skins and mineral acidity. This is a wine for aging, its wood character beautifully judged, rounding out the crisp final texture. Drink from 2016."
"Rich in black cherry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors, this wine offers the firm tannins and minerality that give a young Spring Mountain Cabernet its noticeable characteristics. Give it eight years to begin to come around."
"This brut-style bubbly is comprised of 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay and shows aspects of both varieties. It's fairly full bodied, with raspberry, strawberry, lime, brioche, vanilla and toast flavors. Feels elegant, complex and lush in the mouth, and should develop additional bottle notes over the next six years."
"This is a good example of the high-alcohol style of warmth and deliciousness. While it's not common for Stags Leap wines to have these characteristics, it is incredibly deep in black cherries, milk chocolate and oak, with a spicy finish that goes on for a long time, indicating the power of this Cabernet. Drink over the next six years."
"Unexpectedly thick and mouthfilling, with generous peach aromas and flavors underscored by mustard greens and citrus. Clean and refreshing on the finish. Best Buy."
"Aromas of mature Cabernet: cassis, tobacco leaf and a touch of caramel. Not overly rich or heavy, this is a pretty, lightweight Cab best enjoyed now."
"Fresh and clean, with light, lemony aromas in addition to tropical fruit. The palate is textured and full, with fairly pure apple and pineapple flavors and some nuttiness. Everything works here, including the smooth, lengthy finish.  Best Buy."
"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now."
"The â€œleastâ€ of Lane Tanner's range of Pinots, but complex and delicious. Ripe berry and spice flavors are rich, and there's a tangy earthiness suggesting sauteed mushrooms. Very dry and crisp, with a silky texture and a long, smooth finish."
"From an emerging Mendocino appellation, an engaging, dry wine. Its mouth-cleansing acidity is fresh and clean, highlighting pretty flavors of lime and honeydew, and leads to a tart finish."
"Simple, delicate and fruity, a jammy style with sweetly ripe flavors of wild raspberries and strawberries, as well as espresso, tobacco and Oriental spices. It's light and silky on the palate."
"Creamy aromas of vanilla and pears also carry some typical Sauvignon Blanc pungency. For a rounder style, which it is, it's quite refreshing. The mix across the palate of banana, grapefruit and almonds is attractive, and so is the round, pretty finish. Drink it very soon."
"Lean and angular right now, showing hints of mint and chocolateâ€”the oak sticks out a bit over the tart cherry flavors."
"A good wine, grape-wise, with sharply etched, pure fruity flavors of citrus, fig and sweet tobacco. Acidity is fresh and juicy, and the wine is fully dry. Barrel fermented, it is super-oaky, maybe too much so, from the charry aromas to the woody flavors."
"This is a full-bodied Pinot, packed with ripe cherry and strawberry flavors and framed in spicy nuance. A shade hot on the finish, ending with an unusually bright licorice and herbal edge."
"An open-knit, friendly nose features lots of nectarine and ripe apple scents. Medium-weight, with plenty of stone fruit on the palate, it finishes with a cleansing burst of peppery spice. Try as an apÃ©ritif."
"This is a great house pour for fans of Chilean Merlot with its consistent fruit, soft acidity and low tannins. On the nose and palate, a core of sweet, Red Delicious apple is accented by dry leather, toasty vanilla and dried herbs. Simple, but well crafted."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts off a bit murky and brooding but then displays raspberry and plum fruit, and some big-time heft. A tad oaky and simple, but with grilled meats it should more than do the trick. If you like 'em big and a touch funky, get tattooed."
"Heavy and gold in color, with aromas of browned butter, wheat and corn cakes. The bouquet and color are heavy, and so is the palate: There you get oak barrel and toast, but little to no fruit. Even the finish is woody, with just a hint of melon and banana. A good experimental wine for those eager to taste oak; otherwise steer clear."
"The new clone on the block finally makes it onto the front label. Soft and silky, this wine has cherry-berry flavors with an earthy streak of tobacco and sage. There are some firm tannins that kick in on the finish, which suggest six months of aging."
"The initial nosing reveals a char-broiled character along with maple. That nose turns even darker with airing, indicating that no barrel was spared in the making of this wine. The flavor profile is all dark berries and cream, with yet more wood at the heart. On the tail end, it's dry, broad and full of tannins and extract that coat the mouth. Best Buy."
"A rich, aromatic, honeyed style of Chardonnay, with 100% malolactic fermentation to increase the softness and sweet wood flavors. Soft peach flavors increase the tropical intensity of the wine."
"As easy and tasty as a summer wine gets, this blush also has a lovely coppery-pink color. Flavors of fresh strawberries and spice burst on the palate, and drink just a tad off-dry."
"From a vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, a young, jammy wine bursting with candied flavors of raspberries and cherries. It drinks very concentrated and intense. There's a caramelly note that may come from well-charred barrels in this dry, full-bodied wine."
"Tasty and wonderfully drinkable. The basic flavors are cola and soy, with extra nuances of blackberries, cherries and quite a bit of smoky, sweet oak. Drinks very dry and spicy."
"A taut, citrusy and minerally wine from a grape variety that's often more open and fruity, this offering is nonetheless impeccably fresh and clean, picking up some minty notes on the finish."
"Some earthy, herbal cranberry scents are given life by a touch of smoky oak. The palate is sweet and wholesome, and very well balanced. The finish gives a hint of syrup and oak, but the fruit is ripe and succulent enough to handle that."
"Almost addictive with its fresh, clean flavors of sweet lemon, fig, tart green apple and cinnamon, encased in lively acidity. This zesty white wine has extra layers of complexity and depth. It's also one of the most versatile food wines around."
"Despite the modest price, this wine needs some time in the glass or in a decanter to open up. It starts off slowly, then builds pear and quince aromas and flavors through the long, tart, minerally finish. Best Buy."
"A Soave that has been partially barrel fermented is unusual, but it works in this wine, which has great concentration, roundness and softness and the complexity of toast."
"This luscious, balanced Pinot Grigio isn't overly complex, but scores for its cactus pear and toasted almond aromas and flavors and its peppery, refreshing finish. It's medium-bodied, with just a hint of unreleased CO2 to enliven it."
"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone. And if many Syrah-based wines need time to settle, this one seems made for immediate drinking."
"This Merlot excels beyond its bargain classification by showing purity and a high level of fruit quality. The bouquet exudes plum, chocolate and some creaminess, while the palate bursts with blackberry, bitter chocolate and espresso. Round and satisfying, with enough structure to last a year or twoâ€”or until the next vintage comes around."
"Friendly apple fruit sits easily on nose and palate before a refreshing, clean finish. This is an easy, fruit-driven white ideal for a party."
"Made from the local Sciaccarellu grape, this is a delicious, light and perfumed wine. It has tight acidity to go with the red currant flavors and the crisp texture. The wine is poised and refreshing."
"Lively aromas like crisp apple and white peach join more creamy, pastry-like flavors of butter, vanilla and toasted almond in this medium-bodied wine. It is soft in texture and so fruity it seems sweet on the finish."
"This wine is tangy and textured with light tannins, a bite of citrus acidity and plenty of fruit. It's bright and has a juicy, lively aftertaste. Drink now."
"Largely neutral on the nose, then tangy and still fresh on the palate, this drink-now Viura is clean but unexciting. Flavors of generic citrus finish firm, with a pithy aftertaste."
"Aromas suggesting honeydew melon, exotic fruit and a hint of tomato leaf lead the nose. The simple palate is a bit less expressive, offering grapefruit and a hint of white peach alongside lively acidity."
"Made with white vinification of Aglianico grapes, this has aromas of dried-up chamomile flower and overripe citrus fruit. The simple palate offers crushed white currant alongside zesty acidity."
"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering."
"A pleasant mix of dark berries and fruit lead the bouquet of this friendly wine, with solid notes of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry throughout. A hint of spice adds interest to the finish, with medium-light tannins and ample acidity resulting in good overall balance."
"A softly earthy tone is all the nose gives away. The palate is brisk, neutral and has both freshness and a slightly bitter edge. Drink soon."
"Toasted oak, citrus zest and honey aromas lead followed by a balsamic note. The palate offers walnut, oak and the barest hint of butterscotch but it lacks fruit richness."
"This medium-bodied wine is very fruity in aroma, and exudes ripe pear and fig flavors. Add in creamy vanilla accents and a very soft texture and the effect is almost sweet."
"Dusty earth, seashell notes and tomato aromas don't fully announce how snappy, tart and racy this coastal PN is. Almost sour red-plum and pie-cherry flavors finish angular, sharp and zesty to an extreme."
"This is a juicy and formidably tannic version of the variety, from a famed vineyard known also for Zinfandel. Dry oak and intrusively harsh texture need mellowing before the more gentle notions of dried herb and black cherry can shine."
"Apple and citrus aromas are neither well defined nor overly aromatic. Fresh and juicy on the palate, this offers citrus peel and green melon flavors. Mild and short on the finish."
A soft fruitiness and smooth texture make this medium-bodied red easy to enjoy. Strawberry and cherry notes rest easily on a bed of light tannin that adds an appetizing mouthfeel.
"Black cherry and plum aromas are solid. This is chunky and heavyset, but comfortable across the palate. Generic plum and berry flavors are pure, while this finishes plump, chunky and with a hint of chocolate."
"Aromas of herbal red fruits, tobacco and vanilla are basic and modest. This has a wiry, acidic mouthfeel and flavors of mixed herbs, tomato, pie cherry, red plum and olive. A fresh, racy finish is tangy and tomatoey."
"This might be a touch volatile at first, but saucy tomato-like aromas are offset by fresh red-plum notes. A tight and tannic palate softens with time in the glass, while berry flavors carry herb and spice notes onto a lightly herbal finish."
"This is a very simple, friendly, fresh and lively whiteâ€”easy to drink and enjoy with its lemony freshness. It's ideal for a party."
"This aromatic, medium-bodied white flirts with a distinct grassiness that can overwhelm, before settling into finer notions of grapefruit and stone fruit, as well as ripe, fleshy cantaloupe."
"Chunky aromas of tomato, saucy berry fruits, asphalt and tire rubber are somewhat harsh. Flat and lazy in feel, this chunky, full-bodied number from BÃ­o BÃ­o tastes of baked cherry and plum fruit. A finish with low acidity and not much kick is the ending."
"Lively, spicy oak aromas, rich fruit flavors and a lightly tannic texture make this a well-balanced dry wine that will be great with burgers, ribs or carne asada burritos. The price can't be beat either."
"Straightforward red-fruit aromas suggest cherry and plum. Rubbery, pinching tannins are the adhesive for this punchy young Rioja that tastes of raspberry and cherry and finishes steady."
"Almost white in color, this wine is fruity and crisp with lemon and lime flavors. A light hint of a tannic structure also suggests minerality. The aftertaste is bright and packed with acidity."
"This pale-colored wine has a light, perfumed character. A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it is an attractive, bone-dry rosÃ©, ripe with strawberry fruits, that will be best with food."
"This opens with aromas that recall tropical fruit, hay and a whiff of chopped mint. The palate has weight and an almost oily texture but it lacks fruit richness, suggesting unripe pear, lemon zest and flint alongside brisk acidity."
"Aromas of black plum, black cherry, green bramble and a touch of eucalyptus precede flavors of blackberry, raspberry and red plum."
"Pineapple, citrus blossom, and white peach aromas prepare your palate for tastes of green apple, lemon zest and apricots. The finish is crisp and acidic."
Aromas of black berry and black cherry lead to flavors of cherry vanilla and red plum before a soft tannic finish.
Rich flavors like vanilla and fig combine with a creamy texture and sweet finish to make a cream puff of a wine. The texture is soft and acidity quite low.
"The caramel character of this wine is less attractive than its background of red fruits. The two sides need to come into balance for it to work completely, so wait until late 2016."
"Reedy red-fruit aromas lack the clarity that the best wines of this style show. Grabby on the palate, this tastes of basic plum and raspberry. A raw, tannic, rubbery finish is the final act."
"Bland, fleshy aromas of corn and apple cider are unconvincing but not overtly negative. This feels plump and heavy, like fruit punch. Flavors of cantaloupe and citrus fruits finish yeasty, with notes of corn and white bread."
"A very drinkable, light and easy to like Merlot, this offers ripe notes of black plum, cherry and berry on the nose and mouth, with a faint hint of milk chocolate in the background. The soft mouthfeel and fruity palate finish short, but clean."
"A light, easy and cheery selection, with direct aromas and flavors of sweet cherry, red raspberry and strawberry. The mouthfeel is soft and approachable, with virtually no tannins and a clean, short finish. Drink up."
"There are a lot of uncommon, unusual elements to this Pinot. For starters, the nose is volatile, with notes of horseradish and grapefruit. The palate has a solid, juicy feel to it, while mulchy cherry and plum flavors finish aimlessly."
"This wine smells fruity, like raspberry and cranberries, and turns very tart and astringent on the palate. Sharp fruit flavors come out on the finish along with a metallic edge."
"This is herbal and ripely fruited all at once, smelling like sweet pea, carnation and baby powder combined with tones of plum and cherry. The fruity notes continue through to the medium-weight palate, though they're short-lived."
"This light-bodied Rioja smells of cherry, plum and cotton candy. It's a bit thin on the palate but offers just enough body to be worthwhile. Mild plum and cherry flavors hollow out on the simple finish."
"Forced, candied aromas of chocolaty oak and herbal, slightly weedy berry fruits feed into a chunky, blocky, creamy palate with saucy berry flavors combined with minty, top-heavy oak. The finish tastes minty, lactic and oaky, with heat."
"Berry and cherry aromas register as soupy and flat. Like the nose, this feels flat, chewy and dense. Stewed, rubbery prunes and plums finish with a fig-like note and rubbery tannins."
"Flat, dusty aromas of lees and vanilla cookies are rather lifeless. While this is wet and somewhat juicy in feel, it's bland as a whole, with yeasty melon and citrus flavors that finish bready."
"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, this is a simple, tropically sweet wine, characterized by mango, pineapple and juicy melon."
"This medium-bodied wine has an earthy aroma, muted cherry flavors and a smooth enough texture. It is good and drinkable."
"This full-bodied wine has earthy, woodsy aromas, ripe and mature fruit flavors and a broad, almost soft texture. It's very mouth-filling and smooth, and will please people who like a little rusticity in their wines."
"Aromas like jam and maple syrup and equally ripe, generous flavors give this medium-bodied wine an easy appeal. The texture is soft for this type, the flavors are not too deep and the finish is light."
"Saucy aromas run low on fruit and high on tomato and green herbs. In the mouth, this feels rough. Flavors of bell pepper, pizza sauce and oregano finish without the ripeness that should be present in a high-end 2011 RDD."
"This is a strawberry-pink-colored wine with candied flavors balanced by acidity. It is fruity, crisp and light in character."
"With only the lightest texture, this wine almost tastes like a white wine. It has plenty of citrus character, partnered with apple and green-fruit flavors. At the end, look out for the bite of tannin that gives it a more rosÃ© character."
"Rather vegetal aromas of jalapeÃ±o and bell pepper mix with red fruit on the nose of this bottling. Those same bell peppery notes carry through the palate, which is intriguing but will likely confuse many drinkers."
This is a simple representation of the variety: medium in acidity and weight and a roundness of appropriate apple and pear that finishes flat.
"Woody, creamy aromas of black fruits precede a sketchy palate with acidity akin to vinegar. Medicinal flavors of oak, mint and generic berry fruits finish with a pasty feel and herbal, oaky flavors."
"Prickly, punchy, pryazinic aromas will have you thinking this is Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo. A sharp palate is more about acid than body, while this continues with its SB-like character via green flavors of lime and arugula. A crisp finish evaporates into nothing."
"Heavy oak and marginal white-fruit scents make for a compromised nose. This feels chunky and resiny, with heavy flavors of clove and raw wood. Additional clove notes on the finish render this Chardonnay an underachiever."
"Dark-colored, full-bodied and practically sweet with oak, this box wine spreads spicy flavors around the fruit, and becomes more syrupy with each sip."
"Apple and honeydew aromas show on the nose of this boxed wine, which prides itself on having a small eco-footprint. The palate is flatter than the nose, with green apple skin flavors but not much texture or acidity to speak of."
"Underripe aromas of bell pepper and scallion correctly announce a shearing, high-acid palate. Salty, tart flavors of citrus fruits finish with pyrazine-driven green notes."
"Barely noticeable aromas of wet rocks and sour red-fruit skins try to show on the nose of this wine. The palate is characterized by iron, wet rocks and dust flavors, without much fruit."
"Rustic, gaseous aromas of soupy berry fruits and tire rubber create a struggling nose. Rubbery tannins and a lack of a focal point make for a jumbled palate, while this tastes stewy, weedy and low on fresh fruit."
"This feels very ripe, perhaps overripe, with its seemingly sweet flavor of black fruit juice and its soft structure. It's appealing and does have some tannins, but it is not for aging."
"From Bacio Divino, this Sangiovese-based blend is curiously soft. While it has forward cherry, cocoa and spice flavors, it simply lacks structural integrity.The alcohol is evident on the warm, dry finish."
This is a fresh and fragrant rosÃ© from the Vinho Verde region. It has light acidity and a red fruit flavor. The lightest prickle gives just that extra lift.
"Simple and agreeable, this can be paired with a burger or beef taco. It's dry and clean, with pleasant cherry and cola flavors."
"Simple, dry and one dimensional, this has cola and cherry jam flavors, and a silky, delicate texture."
"Made from a bunch of different varieties, including Viognier and Pinot Grigio, this white blend is off-dry, with a sweet edge to the orange and peach fruit."
This crisp Chardonnay has a disjointedness about it. Its aroma and flavor is most akin to Lemonheads candy.
"Soft, round and gentle, this has a creamed apple flavor. It has a full, ripe character, with just an edge of green herb and spice."
"Light and stalky, this has black currant fruit and considerable acidity. With its soft tannins and fruity character, it is ready to drink now."
"Soft and fruity with some sweetness, this red-fruit-flavored wine is rounded and warm, crispened by acidity."
"Black Box hops onto the popular sweet red wine train with this blend. It is, as advertised, sweet, but not too much, giving a sugary edge to the blackberries and cherries."
"A good Chardonnay to serve at parties, this shows plenty of oak-driven vanilla and toast flavors that ride high over the seemingly sweet note of pineapple candy. It will satisfy lots of Chardophiles, at an affordable price."
"Lightweight, with smooth red fruit and acidity, this is soft and round. The berry fruit neatly merges with the gentle tannins."
"Made in an old-fashioned Paso Robles style, this is pretty sweet, soft and simple. There's not much complexity, but it has plenty of ripe blackberry, cherry and spice flavors."
"This is for you, if you like your Zins in a sweet, soft style. It tastes like the filling from a blackÂ­berry and cherry pie, dusted with exotic spices, like cinnamon and black pepper."
"Apple and white fruit aromas set up a balanced, reasonably full palate, with banana, creamy oak, vanilla and apple flavors. It feels solid and round, with a clean finish."
"Vanilla and toasted almond aromas evolve into a scent of tarte tatin. Full bodied, with warm alcohol, this shows medium fruit concentration. The acidity is borderline in its balance, leaning to flabiness. The tactile heat on the medium finish is distracting."
"The first noticeable aspect is that it seems to have no structure. The cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors have been elaborately oaked, but there's nothing for the mouth to grip onto."
The mouthfeel has sandpapery tannins and some green peppercorn notes alongside riper flavors of blackberries and sweet currants. It's a rustic Zin to drink with barbecue.
"This is a lively, off-dry wine with intense acidity to accompany its crisp apple and citrus flavors. Very fruity, it's ready to drink now. Screwcap."
"Here's a good, robust red wine. It's made in a country-style, with tobacco, cherry and spice flavors and a jagged mouthfeel. Drink it with tacos and burgers."
"Dry and acidic, this has flavors of green mint and sour cherry candy. Not likely to improve with age, but give it an hour in the decanter to let it soften."
"This is a soft, gentle Pinot with a plum jelly flavor derived from a touch of sweetness in its fruit. Drink now."
"Made to appeal to the modern taste for sweetness, this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier is simple in jammy apricot, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It has bright acidity, which helps balance it."
"Bright aromas of woodland berry, tilled earth and violet waft out of the glass. The vibrant palate offers crunchy red cherry, unripe strawberry and a hint of anise accompanied by racy acidity and firm tannins."
"Ebullient blossom and berry notes waft from this unique carbonated Pinot Noir (blended with proportions of Cabernet Franc and Cayuga grapes). Plump strawberry and cherry flavors are dry on the palate, but concentrated, accented by brisk acidity and sharp, piercing bubbles."
"Aromas of iodine, horse hide and saucy berry fruits are intriguing on the nose. The palate is tannic and mildly astringent offering rustic notes of baked, leathery black-fruit flavors. The finish is hot and jammy, with a leathery kick."
"This unusual wine offers aromas of nori, dried flowers, bittersweet chocolate and cherry cola. It's full flavored with a lightly tacky feel."
"Cherry, raspberry and vanilla combine for an inviting mix of ripeness and sweet bouquet. A fruity component also sits nicely atop this structured wine marked by soft, fine tannins. The finish is robust in black pepper and clove."
"Here's an earthy expression of Sangiovese that opens with aromas of truffle, forest floor, ripe plum and a whiff of barnyard. The rustic appeal carries over to the palate, which offers ripe blackberry, ground pepper, bitter sage and a gamey note. Assertive tannins provide backup but leave an astringent finish."
"Pear and spice aromas lead to rich pineapple and prickly pear flavors. There's much to love, with unmistakable varietal expression."
"This wine displays generous aromas of white pepper, woodspice, raspberry and cherry. The flavors are elegant with a peppery finish."
"Robust and brawny, this substantial offering features concentrated layers of smoke, leather and sage-inflected tannins. It finishes in a wrapping of bittersweet chocolate."

"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah shows a somewhat uneasy mix of woodspice, green herb and cherry aromas. Flavors are pleasant, lighter in style and easy drinking, with a refreshing finish."
"This earthy expression of Sangiovese and 10% Colorino opens with funky aromas of scorched soil, truffle and game. The palate offers dried black cherry, toast, clove and a truffle note. Round but somewhat fleeting tannins provide the easy-drinking framework. Drink through 2015."
"This is Provence pink in colorâ€”light and just slightly shaded with copper. It smells floral and fruity, like watermelon, canteloupe and cucumber. The balance is on the sweet side, lending a softness in texture."
"Aromas of charred earth, overripe plum, game and a confectionary note lead the nose of this blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo-Mammolo. The simple, rather rustic palate offers dried black cherry, leather and a hint of clove alongside dusty tannins."
"Dusty, leesy aromas are powdery, with little fruit character. This feels stony on the surface but not deep. Nectarine and tangerine flavors finish cidery and slightly bitter."
"A 100% varietal wine, this opens in floral violet perfume, delicate notions that are soon overpowered by the chock-a-block blackberry and plum. The tannins are robust and still integrating, giving the wine a somewhat harsh feel."
"Aromas of underbrush, toast and dark-skinned fruit lead the nose of this easy-drinking red. The bright, informal palate offers red cherry, pomegranate and a hint of white pepper alongside zesty acidity."
"Unusual aromas of cardamom and cinnamon accent blueberry and plum scents. In the mouth, this is robust and voluminous but mild in terms of tannins and structure. Earthy, stewy plum and blackberry flavors finish charred, with herbal notes and heat."

"A blend of six different varieties with Syrah (72%) in the lead, this pale cherry-color wine pops with aromas of bubble gum, wild strawberry and orange peel. The concentration is a bit light with the tart finish that pulls it together."
"This steely, tangy wine has a strongly mineral characterâ€”tight, taut and crisp. Green fruits, citrus and a grassy character dominate. It is ready to drink. This is an unusual 75% SÃ©million and 25% Sauvignon Blanc blend that tends to round out the taste."
"A property owned by ChÃ¢teau Bel Air, Ouvrard has produced a lightly fruity wine that has fresh red berry fruits and just the right amount of acidity. Light tannins act as a backbone to the general fruitiness of this wine."
"This wine is smooth while keeping all of its fresh wits about it. Citrus, red apple and quince flavors give both spice and ripe fruits. With its lively, tangy aftertaste, it does need to broaden out, so drink from 2016."
"With its dark pink color, this is more red than rosÃ©. It has a tannic edge, along with red plum acidity and fruits. It's clean, allowing space for freshness while also being structured."
"Very crisp and fruity, this is a light, bright and refreshing wine, with a tangy edge that gives texture. Apples and a strong citrus character promise a wine that will round out over the next few months. Drink from late 2015."
"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Muscadelle and SÃ©millon is round, full and softly textured. White fruits, spice and fresh acidity are already well integrated. The end is tangy with lemon zest flavors. Drink now. The estate has been in the Forcato family since 1950."
"Still toasty, this is a fruity, spicy wine. Firm tannins form the backdrop to the red berry fruits and fresh acidity. It will develop attractively over the next few years, so drink from 2017."

The aromas follow over to the rather lean, straightforward palate along with a note of fresh cherry set against loose-knit, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy over the next few years."
"From an estate enveloping a magnificent medieval castle, this is a lightly structured cru wine with red cherry and berry flavors. It has a backdrop of tannins and acidity that give it structure. The wine is ripe and fruity at the end and ready to drink."
Fresh greens and white grapefruit aromas come together in this medium-bodied wine. A silky texture carries celery leaf and citrus flavors through the slightly bitter finish.

"Made with 60% Sangiovese and 40% Vermentino, this offers delicate aromas of red berry, white peach and a hint of Mediterranean scrub that carry on to the palate. It closes on a refreshing citrus note."
"This is a romantic conjunction of names. The cru wine is silky and smooth, with integrated tannins and red-cherry fruit. It is bright and crisply textured, ready to drink from mid-2017."
"This cru wine comes from a 44-acre vineyard with 50-year-old vines supplied by one of Duboeuf's regular growers. It is structured and dense, perhaps too dense with its heavy dry tannins. The wine will need time. Drink from 2019."
"Full of crisp fruit, this cru wine is bright with red-berry flavors. It is light and with a cool character that comes from the high altitude of the vineyards. There is an edgy texture that keeps the wine together. Drink now."

"This medium-bodied wine blends lively citrus and crisp apple aromas with just-rich-enough pear, apple and butter flavors for good balance. Satisfying and refreshing, it will be great with many different dishes."
The flower and peach aromas are quite subdued for the variety. The stone-fruit flavors provide more generosity while still displaying elegance.

"Dark in color, intense in fruit flavor and firmly packed with tannins, this blockbuster Bordeaux-style blend feels massive and grippy. It tastes like cranberry and blackberry, leaving astringency on the palate that will match up to the richest foods. Age a few bottles through 2019 to see how it matures."
"Slightly muted tones of black cherry and plum preserves are accented by wet soil, mushroom and coconut in this rustic yet elegant Cabernet Franc. Ripe fruit is contrasted by vibrant acidity, rigid tannins and a pleasant bite of astringency that persists through the finish. Drink now through 2022."
"Fig, black plum, dried cherry and chai spice show on the nose of this bottling from River Road south of Salinas. Heavy flavors of dried black cherry and dried cranberry show on the sip, lifted by eucalyptus oil, juniper and black-tea elements."
"This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, scorched earth, chopped herb and dried berry. The straightforward palate delivers concentrated black cherry, black currant and dark spice set against rounded tannins. A coffee note signals the close."
Earthy plum and berry aromas come with hints of rubber and animal. This is a saturated chewy dark Malbec with salty blackberry and savory oak flavors. A spicy blackened well-oaked finish is balanced and healthy.
"This opens with aromas of toast, prune, scorched earth and chopped mint. The juicy palate offers dried black cherry, star anise and a hint of sweet baking spice alongside supple tannins. Straightforward and already approachable, it will offer enjoyable sipping in the near term. Drink through 2020."
"Quite light in the glass, the aromas on this bottling are also a bit weak, with cinnamon and red fruits emerging with patience. It's light and lithe on the palate, with candied cherry, rose petals and tons of cracked pepper making for a lengthy, grippy sip."
"This wine is made in a ripe forward style, with lightly volatile aromas of apple, plum and dark raspberries. It's full bodied and pulls no punches as generous red and black-fruit flavors with cocoa accents show some warmth on the finish."
"Roasted smoky berry aromas are good but nothing special. This feels alive and wiry, with grabby tannins and prodding acidity. Roasted spicy plum and berry flavors finish dry, spicy and in good shape."

"Flower petal, mineral and blackberry aromas solidify the bouquet on this excellent Tempranillo. The palate is big and chewy, with fine balance and driving flavors of cherry, plum, vanilla and oak resin. With a finish that's bone dry and focused, this Ribera wine is ready to drink but can last another 5â€“8 years in a good cellar."
"One of the best Stoller Vineyard designates from anywhere, this bright and spicy effort is bursting with flavors of red currants, accented with smoky chocolate. Tannins are fine tuned and the wine has excellent balance throughout."
"The fresh acidity typical of FernÃ£o Pires is broadened by wood aging to yield a wine that has peach, apricot and green-fruit flavors, enhanced by floral aromas. There is a final, mineral texture."
"This is a very successful wine, made in the Paso style of soft voluptuousness and plenty of ripe, fruity flavors. Blended from the classic Bordeaux varieties, it's rich in blackberry and blueberry jam, buttered toast and spice flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Should develop over the next six years."
"A massive wine, rich and forward in black cherry and raspberry jam, red currant, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Structural integrity fortunately provides balance by way of crisp acidity, firm tannins and a rocky minerality. Enjoyable now, after decanting, and should age through 2019."
"California Cabernet simply doesn't get richer or riper than this. It explodes with blackberry and cherry jam and chocolate flavors whose sweetness persists into the long, spicy finish. And yet the wine is technically dry. Drink over the next few years."
"Candied fruit, caramel, smooth vanilla cream and apricot open the opulent bouquet of this beautifully made Riserva Chardonnay. Elena Walch produces one of the best, oak-aged expressions of the grape in Italy. It closes with creamy richness and persistence."
"While this is certainly herbaceous, it also carries richer fruit flavors like apricots and melon to go with the grapefruit acidity. That gives it a rounded texture, full in the mouth and with a touch of minerality. Age this impressive wine another 1â€“2 years."
"Made with fruit from old vines, this deliciously oak-aged Soave Classico is rich and opulent with lovely tones of stone fruit, dusty mineral, melon, dried sage and vanilla spice. The roundness and fullness of the mouthfeel promises five years or more of cellar aging potential."
"How can a wine be softly appealing and yet brisk in acidity at the same time? The paradox is resolved with one sip of this wonderful Pinot. It's rich in raspberry-pie filling and cola flavors, with wonderful spices and a sweet kick of toasted oak. Drink nowâ€“2016."
"Hard to tell the difference between this wine and a Pinot Noir. It's silky, brisk and lightly tannic, with savory raspberry jam, cola, sautÃ©ed mushroom and spice flavors. Drink over the next few years for freshness."
"Pretty expensive for a Petite Sirah, but it really is fantastic. Shows the variety's powerful tannins and fruit, with a velvety texture framing jammy blackberries, blueberries, carob, vanilla, exotic spices and smoky cedar. Will develop for many years, but there's no reason not to drink it now."
"Complex and concentrated, this blend of Cabernets Franc and Sauvignon has weight and richness. The red and black fruits are layered with firm, dry tannins that promise aging. It is rich, the Cabernet Franc showing its characteristic smoky perfumes. Keep for 3â€“4 years."
"This Chardonnay-based sparkler opens with immediate elegance and intensity. The bouquet delivers tones of apricot, exotic fruit, toasted nut and yellow rose. The perlage is steady and clean and the acidity is very nicely balanced."
"A return to elegance, this aromatic, inviting wine suggests ripe fruit dusted with cocoa powder. Raspberries pack a juicy wallop, balanced against hints of clean earth and ripe tannins."
"This is done in an open, palate-friendly style, with rich, generous black fruits accented with cocoa, coffee and caramel. There's a streak of vanilla custard also, and the fruit has enough depth and mass to hold up through a satisfying finish."
"Shows Petite Sirah's tremendous power, with full-bodied blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and pepper flavors, and there's a wonderful meatiness suggesting charred beef fat. The alcohol is high, yet the wine is measured, with firm, ripe tannins. Really a fine expression of Petite Sirah, Paso-style."
"From rocky estate soils, Terre Rouge's Viognier opens with delicious aromas of honeysuckle, mango and guava, lightly put together with a jolt of wet stone. Rich in mouthfeel, the finish is woodsy, like the finest herb garden."
"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now. Shows massively extracted black currant and oak flavors that run deep and long in the finish. Who knows what this wine might do in 10â€“15 years, but it's a roll of the dice."
"Give this brisk, young Pinot 5â€“6 years in the cellar to mellow. It's clearly a very fine wine, clean and elegantly constructed, with rich tannins and a bright squirt of acidity framing ripe cherry, currant and licorice flavors."
"Give this lovely Pinot Noir a few hours in the decanter and serve now with your best lamb and steak entrÃ©es. It's dry, refined in the acid-tannin balance and deliciously complex, with waves of raspberries and cherries, pie crust, baking spices and toasted oak."
"This wine is frankly high in alcohol, clocking in at 16% by volume. But it's also incredibly delicious, offering soft waves of milk chocolate, black cherry jam, red currants, bacon and black pepper. Drink this wine at night, with rich stews or barbecue, but be careful about driving."
"Softly tannic, rich and enormously enjoyable, this RhÃ´ne-style blend offers lush flavors of raspberries, cherries, milk chocolate, crispy bacon, black pepper and sandalwood. The alcohol is heady, but balanced with fine acidity. Drink over the next two years for freshness."
"A block of vines set literally near a grove of Redwood trees, the 2010 Redwood's Edge is structured and slightly austere and elusive, a concentrated rendering of deep, dark red fruit, lavender and woody undertones that's incredibly delicious."
"Spicy and floral, with pretty cherry fruit concentrated at the core, this inviting Grenache combines grace and power. The flavors are complex and concentrated, with hints of green tea, cut tobacco, and a finishing streak of espresso and cocoa."
"A super-rich wine, almost over the top in its honeyed intensity. It is opulent, generous, packed with ripe yellow fruits, mango and pineapple. The wine is so rich that it is hard to find the acidity, but it is there in the orange marmalade flavor right at the end."
"This wine from ChÃ¢teau LagrÃ©zette is powerful and dense in its own right. It has black, juicy, tar-like flavors with tannins concentrated into a dry, dark core. Blended with a small proportion of Merlot, there is just a touch of softness which will allow the wine to mature in the next 2â€“3 years."
"A dark, brooding wine, packed with firm tannins and solid plum-skin and licorice flavors. The wine is dense and complexâ€”a powerful evocation of Malbecâ€”allowing the juicy fruits to merge with the young structure that needs agng for at least 4â€“5 years."
"This edition of Dosaggio Zero shows delicate harmony and complexity with layers of stone fruit, citrus, almond and white flower. Zesty perlage is enhanced by more stone fruit flavors on the silky finish."
"The top wine from Domaine de Cause, it's huge, very dense and concentrated. There is a sense of extraction, showcased by the licorice and dark chocolate flavors. This needs to calm down to give the rich fruits a chance to shine. Give this wine 6â€“7 years."
"Reduced, floral and plummy on the nose, this is a simple, blocky, tannic young wine. Medicinal berry flavors finish loud and grapy, with a grabby, tacky feel. Fruit outweighs finesse."
"In this case, Vieilles Vignes (old vines) only means vines over 20 years. The wine is soft, rounded and full of red cherry fruitiness. Judicious wood aging has rounded the wine out while leaving all its fruit intact. It can be drunk now, but will be better from 2016."
"Aromatically appealing, it features notes of allspice, herbs, cola and cherry. The palate is lighter in style with a scrape-y feel, not fully delivering on all that the aromas have to offer."
"This light-colored wine has a spicy character that points up the tannins as well as the red berry fruits. It has a light feeling, with refreshing acidity that shows strongly at the end. It's ready to drink."
"Aromas of tobacco leaf, wet soil, mature plum, resin and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate offers dried prune layered with notes of chocolate and grilled sage. The fleeting finish closes on a rather bitter note."
"Yellow fruits and apple juice combine in this fresh, mineral-driven wine. It's tangy, tight with acidity while allowing room for pineapple and tropical flavors at the end. It's ready to drink but will be better in 2016."
"A faint hint of pink shines on this sparkler named after the winery owners' dog. Aromas of fresh melon and slight peach lead to a faint cherry note upon sipping and creamy mouthfeel, followed by plum skin tartness and a yeasty, sour bitterness."
"Wiry cherry aromas are a touch cheesy and also medicinal. This is pinched and astringent, with a choppy mix of buttery red-berry flavors and vanilla. Like most 2008s, this finishes hard and abrupt, with staunch tannins."
"Made principally from Touriga Nacional, this is a rich wine with attractive acidity and strawberry fruitiness. It is ripe, touched with caramel and finished with wild raspberry flavors."
"Subdued aromas recall white flower and stone fruit. The muted palate reveals mature yellow apple skin, lemon zest and notes of nut butter alongside sharp bubbles. It has a tangy but fleeting finish."
"This is fresh, not quite dry and a fine apÃ©ritif wine. With its soft texture, apple fruits and light mousse, it's both fruity and crisp, with a rounded, fragrant aftertaste."
"Crisp and textured, this offers plenty of fresh apple and red fruit flavors. It's a light, bright wine that's poised and stylish, in a fine apÃ©ritif style."
"Vibrantly fruity, it offers aromas of currant, raspberry, celery stalk and spice. The palate has tart cranberry flavors, finishing a bit short."
"This Garnacha is heavily oaked.Smoky, woody aromas come with dusty berry notes, while the palate is heavy, with cheek-smacking tannins. Flavors of hickory and roasted blackberry finish with another creamy, woody dose of oak."
"This toasty bottling shows some evident maturity in terms of fruit richness. It offers toasted walnut, espresso, vanilla and yellow apple-skin flavors alongside large, brisk bubbles and crisp acidity."
"One of the lesser-known of the many MÃ¢con appellations, PÃ©ronne is close to ClessÃ©. The wine is smooth, ripe and fruity, with a creamed pear and lightly lemon flavor. With a hint of minerality, it could age until 2016."
"From the recent appellation at the southern end of the CÃ´te de Beaune, this is a light and very fruity wine with little discernible tannin or structure. Red cherries and fresh acidity dominate and the wine should be drunk young."
"This starts out savory and smoky on the nose, but with airing it turns murky. The palate is tight in structure, with red-fruit acidity. Flavors of cherry, raspberry and oaky vanilla turn roasted and stalky as this unwinds on a fresh-feeling finish."
"Dust and pollen notes linger from nose to finish on this dry, full-bodied Riesling. Apple and pear flavors are a tad savory, but brightened by crisp lemon acidity. A refreshing and easy drinking wine."
"Dusty, medicinal berry and plum aromas are open and bright. A juicy but pinched palate features narrow flavors of plum and berry skins, while the finish is rubbery in feel, with astringency as well as bright residual fruit flavors."
"Aromas of peach blossom, citrus and a yeasty note of fresh biscuits lead the nose on this 100% Chardonnay. The palate offers walnut husk, lemon zest and a confectionary note alongside sharp acidity."
"Soft and supple, this has a heavy streak of spearmint and an herbal finish that also offers dark black cherry and ripe, leathery tannins."
"Reduced, stewy, lightly herbal aromas blend berry and tomato scents. The acidity on this five-grape blend is pointed and overriding. Flavors of herbal berry and currant are tangy but also stewy, while the finish is long and green in flavor."
"This is a fairly light, bright Pinot Noir with the marks of a ripe year and time spent in oak. It is crafted under the guidelines of a certified sustainable grape growing program. Medium-bodied and juicy, it's fairly priced and ready to enjoy now."
"Soft and ripe, this has strawberry fruit flavors, a soft texture and a warm, rich feel. There is just enough acidity to balance this really food-friendly rosÃ©."
"Rustic aromas recall wet earth, barnyard and leather with a whiff of ripe, black fruit. The thick palate is rather muddled and delivers both sweet and bitter sensations of prune, overripe black plum, confectionary flavors, vanilla and notes of resin alongside astringent tannins that dry out the mouth."
"The pink hue is a little flat. That also applies to the palate, with the fruit showing some maturity and hinting at wood aging. It's a rounded style, full in the mouth, with ripe caramel flavors at the end. Drink now."
"Light and bright, this has a crisp prickle on the tongue, along with canned grapefruit and tight apple-skin flavors. It is almost dry, which gives the wine a mineral texture that adds a bite. Drink now."
"A pretty, grapey wine with tones of pine and lemon underlying flavors of green plum and quince. It's flavorful, off-dry and refreshing; a good expression of Seyval Blanc."
"A little too dry and tannic, with earthy flavors of tobacco, sage, pepper and dried leather, which only partially relieve the modest blackberries and black currants. Way too astringent all the way through."
"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click."
"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors. Finishes saucy, with a hint of tomato. Not pure and focused like the La Flor Malbec."
"In a piece of French wine shorthand, the new appellation of Saint-Bris takes in the old Sauvignon de Saint-Bris wines. The style, though, hasn't changed: an attractive, if rustic type, with crisp gooseberry and grapefruit flavors and a fresh burst of acidity. Screwcap."
"Dry and rough in texture, with berry, cherry, tobacco, herb and spice flavors wrapped into edgy, slightly green tannins. Turns sharp on the finish, and not likely to age."
"Dry, with thick tannins housing blackberry, herb and olive flavors. Drink now."
"Charming and perfumed, with notes of musk, white flowers and wild grapes on the nose and exotic spices in the mouth. This is not a concentrated wine, but there's enough acidity here to balance the slight sweetness and to make it a refreshing apÃ©ritif. Drink up."
"Berry, pickle and bramble aromas are a little tough and crusted over, while the palate is snappy and fresh in feel, with flavors of herbal berry fruit and pepper. A mild hint of oak and resin dry up the finish."
"The nose is honest and bright but not terribly expressive, with just a few delicate raspberry and cherry tones. In the mouth, bing cherry and damp earth notes takes over and continue on the medium finish. Try with a veal chop. Drink up."
"A good, dry Chardonnay that gets the job done at a fair price. Shows peaches and cream flavors with a bit of sharpness and green herbs on the finish."
"A raw, rustic blend based on Sangiovese and Merlot, this wine is very dry and astringent in tannins. It's an old-fashioned wine that's technically without flaws."
"Basic apricot and peach aromas lead to melon, banana and pithy flavors. The palate is a little thick and mealy, while the finish has pretty good feel and length, but not much flavor. Slightly tropical and simple."
"Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor. Good enough but lacks the concentration and deeper aromas and flavors of Urban Malbec."
"A luxurious mouthfeel and good concentration are this wine's chief attractions. Flavors are more earthy than fruity, with tones of compost and stewed prunes. Medium finish shows ripe but slightly drying tannins. Drink now."
"Slightly sweet, with a honeyed edge to the rich pear, apple, peach and tropical fruit flavors. Just-in-time acidity fortunately provides balance."
"Despite some black cherry richness, there's a green, minty, stalky note of unripeness in this blend of Grenache, Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre that limits its appeal. Decanting doesn't help and neither will aging."
"There is potential in this wine that bodes well for the future of Sangiovese in Virginia. The nose is charming, with mocha, fall leaves and cherries that slide into a silky palate with woodsy touches. Juicy, raspberry-inflected finish. Try with steak. Drink now."
"Clove and vanilla make for a serious, if not terribly refreshing, opening. There's nice grapefruit and pomelo fruit here and a medium, lemony finish that veers towards tart. Drink up."
"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles. It's a light, pleasant red, fine for pizza night."
"Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole."
"Acidity dominates this wine, giving it a tart, almost sour taste. Couple that with the sizable tannins, and you have an uncomfortable wine. Call it rustic, old world. The blackberry, currant, coffee and herb flavors are fine."
"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit."
"Readily likeable, with a nose of summer fruit soup layered over notes of field greens. The texture is lazy, with moderate acidity and almost no tannin. Try with ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce. Drink now."
"Confected but pleasant aromas of cotton candy and sour apple drops dominate the nose, while the palate unfolds nicely with layers of lemon and red apple. Soft and lush, it picks up an apricot accent on the medium finish. Try with Thai food. Drink now."
"Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalapeÃ±o and bell pepper, with some lime in the background. Short on the finish, and kind of dilute."
"This vineyard has proven it can ripen good Malbec, but here it seems as if something has gone sideways. There is a gluey scent underneath the blackberry fruit, and the wine seems chalky and disjointed in the mouth, with more of the band-aid flavors in the finish."
"This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity. Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors. There's not a lot of bright fruit or nuance, but it will ably partner simple grilled meats."
"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish."
"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made."
"A solid entry into the everyday Cabernet sweepstakes. Shows ripe, juicy blackberry, cassis and spice flavors in a smooth, polished texture whose tannins cry out for steaks and chops."
"Features pleasant but slightly simple flavors of candied cherries and cedar, with a smooth mouthfeel and just a hint of tannin on the finish. Drink now. Imported by Walca International."
"Mildly smoky and toasty aromas lead to a lightly oaked palate that's largely defined by black cherry and some rich berry syrup. It's a full, colorful Syrah with a chunky mouthfeel and a satisfying but short finish. Drink now."
"Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity."
"There's a tobacco and tomato leaf character that gives this an almost floral aroma, but also simpler cassis and cherry fruit. Some herbal notes persist on the palate, but this medium-bodied wine avoids the vegetal side of things, finishing fresh and clean."
"Nice and drily balanced, this is pretty tannic, with blackberry, cherry, leather, carob, coffee and peppery spice flavors that finish with an intriguing touch of tangerine rind. Drink now."
"This is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity. Cassis, tobacco and a hint of vanilla account for the bulk of the aromatic and flavor interest, and it turns mouthwatering on the finish. Should hold well through 2015."
"A ripe, crisp, very fresh Chablis bursting with green fruits, with a light layer of caramel and green herbs. Delicious now."
"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness."
"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines."
"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out. With its good acidity and zest, this wine won't ever be called flabby. Drink now for solid results."
"This is a blend of Inzolia and Sauvignon from a producer located high up the steep mountains above CefalÃ¹ on Sicily's western flank with cool nighttime temperature and soothing breezes. Straightforward aromas include green herb, white stone and citrus."
"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus. Dried apricot and a nick of passion fruit work the finish. Drink immediately."
"Shows some slightly green tomato-leaf and bell-pepper notes as well as hints of leather and hung game, but despite all that, there's also ripe cassis and chocolate flavors and a supple mouthfeel. Imported by MHW,Ltd."
"From one of Sicily's most beautiful and promising vineyards, Baccante is a blend of Grillo and Chardonnay with bright clean acidity and fragrant yellow fruit. The only setback here is a matchstick aroma (not present in past years) that prevents this vintage from scoring higher."
"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic. Chewy and earthy, with more than a hint of seed and stem, this wine comes from biodynamically farmed grapes that add some earthy nuances, but put too much emphasis on green tea, stemmy flavors."
"Earthy, soft and dry, this Zin has tobacco, cherry, blackberry and spice flavors, with an edge of sweet leather and pine. It's a refreshingly simple country-style Zin that will be nice with barbecue."
"Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever. Give it some time, but don't expect it ever to become sophisticated."
"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an â€˜03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired."
"Seems rather oak-dominated, boasting ample brown sugar, vanilla and dill scents backed my some briary, blackberry fruit. Fills out a bit with air, so decant an hour or so prior to serving. Drink now."
"Like a trip through an orchard, this Syrah, Grenache and MourvÃ¨dre blend bursts with flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, tangerines, kumquats, dates, golden mangoes, yellow currants, the list goes on and on. It's a little on the sweet side, while grippy tannins give the palate handrails to negotiate this fruity ride."
"This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking."
"With polished blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this affordable Cab represents a good value. It's soft, dry and stylish, and easy to drink."
"This ripe and spicy wine from the Dop family's 27 acres offers layers of black fruits. It has a concentrated texture and a firm structure that is juicy while dense. With this richness, the wine will develop into a smooth and generous wine. Drink from 2019."
"This Cru Bourgeois estate has produced a structured wine that is still showing strong wood-aging flavors. Toasty as well as ripely fruity, it has firm tannins and good aging potential. The aftertaste is fruity and spicy. Drink from 2019."
"This vineyard is at one of the highest Castillon points. Big in tannins and also fruit, this is a dense wine. It has a dry core as well as rich blackberry fruits. Concentrated and full, the wine will be seriously worth drinking from 2019."
"Owner Thierry Valette has been around the Right Bank (the family owned Pavie and owns Troplong Mondot) and, as a consultant, the world. Here he offers a delicious juicy wine with fine tannins and ripe red fruits. It has mint and spice perfumes along with balanced acidity. Drink this attractive wine from 2018."
"This Alliance Bourg co-op wine is packed with minty new-wood aromas, this has the potential to be a smooth, polished wine. The blend is 70% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc. Firm tannins at this stage do not mask the ripe blackberry fruits. Give this wine until 2019 before drinking."
"Intense notes of ripe red and baked apples make a strong impression. The palate is rich with the same baked apple along with a touch of honey and gingerbread. The yeasty flavors of autolysis provide an ideal backdrop for this structured, grown-up and classy wine. The finish is totally dry and wonderfully long."
"You've got to like oak to appreciate this wine, which is presently dominated by scents of vanilla, mocha and toasted coconut. It's full bodied and velvety in texture, with hints of black cherry lurking in the background."
"Mouthfilling and round, this wine's savory notes of roasted meat, mocha and cracked pepper frame plummy fruit. Vanilla creeps in on the long, supple finish. Drink now through 2025."
"This thick, concentrated wine offers complex notions of sandalwood and soapstone, savory in pleasant ways. Clove accents the warmth of strawberry compote laced in rhubarb."
"An attractive, oaky perfume and melt-in-the-mouth fruit and dark-chocolate flavors make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. It has a luscious, mouth-coating texture, beautifully ripe blackberries and cherries, and a lingering finish."
"This big, dramatic wine has a dark color and bold aromas of wood smoke and black pepper. Flavors are concentrated but also dry and appetizing. Firm tannins add grip and seem to help the peppery, smoky accents linger on the finish. Best after 2020."
"Although one of the cheaper Zins in the winery's line-up, it is showing the best right now, so drink up. Black cherry, licorice, smoked beef and a deep hibiscus note make for a very heady nose. There is a dense yet soft character to the well-structured palate, where strong flavors of blueberry, crushed slate, tobacco, leather and wild herbs make a tasty convergence."
"Enticing scents of fragrant blue flower, red berry and baking spice lift out of the glass. The bright savory palate offers strawberry, raspberry, wild cherry, and tangerine alongside zesty acidity and a firm, continuous perlage."
"Superbly warm weather in 2015 gave an extra boost of sunshine to many of the Mosel's entry-level wines, and the RK is one of the best. Whiffs of freesia and tangerine peel waft from the glasss of this semidry Riesling. It's low in alcohol, yet so honeyed and ripe that flavors of grapefruit and peach seem to slick sumptuously on the palate. Zesty lime acidity freshens a lingering finish."
"This sensational effort was fermented and briefly aged in neutral oak. The striking package sets it apart from all other Rex Hill wines, and the rich, complex flavors add to the impression that this is something truly special. Red berries, blood orange, a touch of Grand Marnier, impressive body and spicy highlights all combine in a darn near irresistible rosÃ© with the power to be a four season wine."
"This rich, rewarding wine pleases in baked blueberry pie and a taste of raisin cake, its texture underlined in soft, integrated oak and a velvety density. Cinnamon, black pepper and toffee weave within the waves of ripeness."
"The vineyard source for this tasty wine is farmed by a fifth-generation Japanese-American originally from California's Central Valley. Tightly wound in oak and tannin, it opens pleasantly to reveal a wealth of rose petals, earth and youthful ripe, dark cherry. With moderate acidity and body, it lingers on the palate."
"The nose is uncertain and hovers between musky botrytis and lactic tartness. The palate removes all doubt and shines with luscious, concentrated sweetness, referencing the pleasant bitterness of honeycomb and the spice of maple syrup. Pure lemon freshness illuminates everything. Drink now through 2025."
"A solid value, the 2013 Pillar Box offers oodles of blackberry and plum fruit, framed by vanilla and accented by mocha. It's creamy-velvety in texture, with a rich long finish. Drink now through 2025."
"A fresh-baked bread aroma and flavors like butter and baking spices make this full-bodied wine very attractive. It has ample acidity to balance the rich texture, and a lingering finish that completes the classic profile."
"Deep and lush aromas of candied blueberry and black cherry meet with chocolate cake, light brown spices and a touch of beef jerky on the nose of this judiciously priced wine. Though a tad light on the palate at first, it has an energetic and spicy acidity that carries forth flavors of tobacco and black fruit."
"Enticingly fragrant, this offers alluring scents of rose, perfumed berry, chopped mint, menthol and cake spice. The elegant palate delivers tart red cherry, aromatic herb and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. A mineral note signals the close. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2019â€“2032."
"Although this is a nonvintage wine, it is a blend around 2012, hence the number in the name. Dominated by Pinot Noir, this ripe, full-bodied wine has a tangy texture boosted by acidity that contrasts with rich red apple and crisp pear flavors that give richness. Drink now."
"Aromas of orchard fruit, dried herb and toasted bread crust lead the nose. The creamy palate offers mature apple, white peach, nectarine and mineral alongside an elegant perlage that carries through to the bone-dry yet succulent finish."
"Notes of ripe yellow apple play enticingly on the nose. They expand to full force on the palate and fill the mouth with their mellow goodness, supported in this by rich notes of shortbread and wonderful lemon freshness. The bubbles are creamy and disperse the lovely flavors to great effect. This is classy and delicious."
"Whiffs of candlestick and honeycomb lend subtlety to zesty white-grapefruit and honeydew flavors in this dry Riesling. While rich, round and supple in mouthfeel, it's balanced squarely by acidity and a pleasant bite of lemon zest."
"Small red berry, spring flower, bread crust and Mediterranean brush aromas lift out of the glass. The vibrant palate delivers McIntosh apple, tangerine, ripe red berry and baking spice alongside fresh acidity and a soft, continuous mousse. A mineral note wraps around the crisp finish."
"This version of old-vines Carignan-Garnacha is heavily toasted to the point of smelling charred, with coffee and cured-beef notes. Big and blocky on the palate, reflecting a warm year, this tastes toasty, with flavors of wild herbs, baking spices, char and black fruits in the background. Licorice notes and a final blast of char control the finish. Drink through 2021."
"Dry, dusty, elegant peach and minerally notes open this excellent AlbariÃ±o. The lightest bit of spritz gives edge and zest to a medium-full palate. Flavors of stone fruits, wild herbs, field greens and white pepper finish healthy, with a melony aftertaste."
"This fragrant blend of 70% Nebbiolo and 30% Vespolina opens with enticing scents of violet, rose, truffle and baking spice. The chewy, accessible palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry compote, white pepper and cinnamon while smooth supple tannins provide the framework. An almond note closes the finish. Drink through 2022."
"This is rich and dense in blackberry and cherry jam, currant, mocha, anise and smoky cedar flavors. The mountain tannins are strong but refined, and the finish is long and spicy. It's a Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but be forewarned: It's high in alcohol."
"Pamplin's admirable focus on its pair of Bordeaux-style blends is rather rare. This is the more expensive of the two, and a fine, fat, forward bottling in this warm vintage. It's three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with lovely fruit that's compact upon opening, fleshing out with air time. Clean, dense and focused, it is bright with berry and cassis flavors, plus subtle barrel notes."
"A rich mix of red, blue and black fruit opens into a sappy, spicy midpalate. The lush fruits are highlighted by a wash of milk chocolate. At first tightly wound, the wine seems to show more oak flavors with air, hinting at licorice and Bourbon barrel."
"A hint of mint can be detected in the opening aromas of this Merlot, which includes a splash of Cabernet Franc in the blend. Licorice, smoke and deep cassis flavors all contribute to an intense, seductive wine, with velvety tannins enrobing a lingering finish."
"Just beautiful, this is the best Sterling Reserve Cabernet in years, and a huge improvement over the 2008. It shows ripe, lush flavors of blackberry and black cherry pie, anise, cola and smoky sandalwood, wrapped into sweetly gentle, complex tannins. Drink this beauty over the next six years."
"This is a lush and satisfying Rivesaltes AmbrÃ©, made from 100% White Grenache and aged in oak for seven years. There's a gorgeous rancio quality to the wine with notes of almond and orange rind throughout, framed by aromas and flavors of quince paste, wood-grilled peach, fruit cake and carmelized date. The long finish shows good evolution, transitioning from notes of stone fruit to peach pit and finally ending on a sweet spice accent."
"A beautiful expression of Sangiovese, this shows delicate and elegant characteristics of wild berry and light spice. The finish is silky and crisp, and the wine would stand up nicely to breaded veal or roast chicken."
"Deeply layered and pure on the nose, with tar, cola and toasty oak aromas, this feels deep, full and choppy, with tough tannins and seriously dark flavors of blackened spice, berry and bitter chocolate. It's very long on the finish, which has a tough feel but is generous and loaded with power. Drink 2013â€“2018; 275 cases made."
"This is pure single-vineyard Syrah, dark and tasting of cassis and blackberry, with a slightly briny, oyster-shell undercurrent. As it breathes, it displays a cured meat flavor, with a lively, citrusy finish accented by espresso."
"Showing as much freshness and acidity as the hallmark spice of a GewÃ¼rztraminer, this is a white-fruit-dominant wine, poised and elegant, with a touch of minerality. Keep for 2â€“3 years."
"This blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with impressive intensity, with notes of bold cherry, crushed black pepper, clove, dried currant and tobacco. The mouthfeel is velvety and rich, with a touch of bright acidity on the finish."
"This retains so much freshness, with just a hint of toast showing at the back of a wine that otherwise projects minerality, a tight structure and intense citrus acidity. It should be aged for several more years."
"This is a powerful, wood-aged wine. It's still showing its toast at the moment, but expect the wine to round out, yielding solid tannins and a concentrated black-plum flavor. With a rich yet firm finish, this should age well over several years."
"This Merlot-dominated blend features juicy berry flavors and tart, citrusy acids. It has gentle details of pepper, herb, lemon verbena and orange peel. It's a pleasure to see more elegant complexity in these latest Spring Valley reds."
"This ripe, full, almost toasty wine tastes of tropical fruit and spice, giving it an exotic feel. At the same time, the right amount of acidity acts as a fine balance. This concentrated wine, medium-sweet in style, should be aged for 2â€“3 years."
"Fans of ripe, sweet fruit will love this Pinot. It's huge in juicy raspberry and cherry, with spicy hints of Dr. Pepper and red licorice. It will be fun to see how the wine evolves over the next 6â€“8 years."
"Tight, dark and oaky on the nose, this has woody power, cedary complexity and lots of staunch berry character. It is full, grabby and tannic, showing a firm spine to support toasty, oaky, clove-influenced flavors. Dark, tight and toasty on the finish; drink nowâ€“2019."
"â€œRhÃ´ne times threeâ€ seems to be the code name for this classy blend of Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah. It takes the best from each grape, creating a rich, pure, high-acid wine with a zingy berry flavor, plus a mineral underpinning and earthy, coffee-soaked tannins."
"Styled after the great white wines of Bordeaux, this is fresh and clean, with luscious mixed fruit flavors that emphasize apple and melon. A cooler vintage has produced a wine of low alcohol and real finesse, with a light dusting of toasty oak. Given its impeccable balance, it could be cellared for another 6â€“8 years."
"A blend of 58% Syrah, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% MourvÃ¨dre, this combinins power with a big yum factor. Potent and rich, with woody, spicy highlights, the juicy fruit flavors favor blackberry and black cherry. A whiff of smoke runs through the finish."
"The chalk soil of the Rabenstein Vineyard has 50-year-old vines, which produce a dense, concentrated wine. Spice and mineral characters combine with creamed apple in a rich display. The wine could certainly age over the next 3â€“4 years. Screwcap."
"Beautifully aromatic, this purple-hued wine offers generous plum and black cherry flavors that are cloaked in mocha, with muscular, earthy tannins. It spent over two years in barrel (half new oak), and will benefit from a bit more bottle age for all of its rich flavors to fully integrate."
"Cola, coconut and ripe blackberry aromas are draped all over the wine's bouquet. On the palate, it's a bit choppy and acidic, with pounding flavors of black cherry, blackberry and leather. Juicy, zesty and jagged feeling at the moment, this should be consumed no earlier than 2014 and may be at its best around 2018."
"This is so chocolaty and rich, it's impossible to resist a second or third glass. Although it's heady in alcohol, there's an excellent burst of acidity, and the texture is pure velvet. The blackberry tart, orange zest, spice and sandalwood flavors change continuously as the wine warms in the glass."
"This is classically proportioned in the warm-climate style. It provides a textbook example of the variety's inky black and purple color, rich, thick tannins and elaborate flavors. These flavors include profoundly ripe summer blackberry and mulberry, smoky, umami-rich bacon and sweet sandalwood. Full-bodied and dry, this is a wine to warm the blood on cold winter nights."
"Very opulent and jammy in blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, this has a strong oak presence in the form of caramelized wood. It defines Napa richness, but it is too tannic and immature to properly enjoy now. Give it a snooze for 6â€“8 years."
"This mature wine, has lost youthful fruitiness and gained a more nutty, smooth and rich quality. There are touches of toastiness and almonds, with an aromatic aftertaste. Drink now."
"Fleshy oily aromas of orange peel and white flowers lead to a chunky, citric palate that's more full and blocky than elegant. Briny orange and tart nectarine flavors finish plump."
"Oaky toast, cedar and hint of meat add complexity and flavor to this light-bodied, mellowed wine, highlighted by soft, firm tannin and brooding blackberry."
"Violet, plum, black cherry and cooking spice aromas take center stage on this enjoyable red. The juicy tangy palate doles out blackberry, raspberry, white pepper and a hint of cinnamon framed in chewy tannins."
"This wine offers perfumed aromas of clove, blue fruit, orange peel, toast and wild flowers. The flavors show restraint, with fruit and barrel flavors lingering on the finish."
"Aromas of raspberry and herb intermingle on the nose, which also shows a touch of reduction. The palate offers soft tart fruit flavors that provide appeal."
"Aromas of truffle, spiced blackberry, violet and a whiff dark spice come together on this. The chewy medium-bodied palate offers black cherry, plum and clove framed in fine-grained tannins."
"This is a fruity, juicy wine with wood and bright red fruits in equal balance. The entry-level wine made by a grouping of 19 growers, it has concentration along with minerality and acidity. It needs to age further, so drink from 2018."
"Named after a local volcanic rock formation, this wine is a delicious blend of Aragonez (aka Tempranillo) and Touriga Nacional. It is rich and smooth with black fruits, soft tannins and an aftertaste that is lively with acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
"This salmon-colored rosÃ© is made from the Trepat grape. It smells common, with yeasty bready notes of orange peel and orange blossom. A basic palate is balanced, while this tastes of leesy dried melon prior to a medium-long finish."
"Aromas of mineral, flowers and freshly cut green apple are followed by a just off-dry, lightly spritzy palate full of stone-fruit flavors."
"Light spicy, earthy aromas, tart raspberry and cranberry flavors and a firmly tannic texure add up to a well-structured and rather lean-tasting wine. It makes a good accompaniment to food."
"The aromas are bright, with notes of lime leaf, apricot, citrus peel, flowers and lime. It drinks off dry, with abundant stone-fruit flavors that provide plenty of pleasure."
"This three-acre parcel has produced a beautiful fruity wine. With red cherry and spice flavors, the wine is perfumed and juicy. Crisp acidity shoots through the attractive fruit to give a wine that is only lightly tannic and ready to drink."
"Cherry, cassis and root beer aromas are appealing. In the mouth, this is wall-to-wall rough due to fierce tannins. Baked berry flavors are blocky and simmer away on a rugged finish."
"Named after the steeply sloping vineyard, the wine is cool, crisp with tight cherry flavors. It is lined with acidity and some tannins. The wine will need another few months to soften out and become richer."
"This is an up-and-coming variety for the state. High-toned aromas of lime leaf and citrus are followed by a lean, almost faint but still but well-balanced palate with a thread of acidity running through it. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
"Warm yellow apple, light custard and white peach combine for a creamy nose on this bottling from the Riboli family's new estate vineyard. The sip starts with a sizzle of acidity and then shows flavors of caramelized green apples and a touch of banana, proving both a tad tart and a tad rich."
"This fruity, jammy and ripe wine is full of black-plum flavors. It has solid tannins and a dense structure along with layers of wood aging and fruitier acidity. Drink this wine now."
"Light bodied and fresh, this has alluring scents of small red berry, aromatic herb and a floral note. The vibrant palate delivers tart red cherry, white pepper and a hint of thyme. Firm acidity and pliant tannins provide the easy-drinking framework"
"Dark shades of smoked nuts, char and dried, savory herbs mingle amidst ruddy black cherry and cranberry flavors in this bold, intensely structured Pinot Noir. It's a big, richly textured wine enveloping the palate in folds of dense black fruit. Fine but slightly bitter tannins mark the finish."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec is a steal, offering a robust touch of char on the front end aromatically before unleashing bright red fruit and soft tannin. Ultimately light bodied, it retains just the right amount of grippy tannin to give it some bite."
"This powerful wine puts purple plum and tart cherry fruit front and center. That fruit drives the bus through a dense palate, with a burst of acidity adding a turbo charge. It saw 25% new French oak."
"This perfumed expression of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot shows a great depth of complexity and deliciousness for the price. Firm, grippy tannin stars alongside dark cherry, currant, clove and tobacco, all along a softened layering of texture."
"This is an interesting medium-bodied wine from one of the oldest and largest wineries in the foothills. It is not heavy or rich, but has an appetizing dry flavor and firm texture. It will pair well with food since it has good balance."
"Loamy berry aromas smell a bit like wet clay and earth. This is fairly well structured, with grippy tannins. Baked, savory, oaky berry flavors finish with wood spice, clove and light herbal notes."
"Earthy black-fruit aromas set up a rubbery, heavy palate with plenty of oak and related resin. This tastes mostly of oak and clove, with savory blackberry notes resting at the base. A solid salty choppy finish shows a tight grip and moderate roughness."
"The wine is still young with its crisp red fruits and tense tannins. It is a structured wine, firm with a dry core and still developing its fruitiness. It will need to age a while yet, so drink from 2018."
"The aromas are light, with notes of freshly cut apple and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a very pretty styling."
"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor."
"A wonderfully smooth, dry, complex young Cabernet, and yes, the tannins have that famous Rutherford dust. The wine is the opposite of a fruit bomb, with moderate alcohol and interesting flavors of herbs, cherries, blackberries and spicy sandalwood. As good as it is now, it should ride out the next 8â€“10 years."
"Young and tart in cool-climate acidity, this Pinot needs time in the cellar. It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone. It's as cellarable a Pinot Noir as exists in California. Best after 2015."
"Structured, concentrated, a wine that shows power from both fruit and tannins. The opulent strawberry flavors are paralleled by firm, dry tannins. As the combination comes together, this will become a glorious wine."
"Consistent year after year, this blend of 67% Sauvignon Blanc and 33% SÃ©millon is modeled after top-flight white Bordeaux. Deep gold, toasty and scented with olive oil, walnuts and loam, it hits the palate full-on with a rainbow of flavors: citrus, stone and tropical fruits, all accented with toast, oil and nuts from barrel aging. Riveting, delicious  and unique."
"A stellar, superb wine that embodies all the grace, power and charm of the Mount Etna volcano in Sicily. This highly unique and distinctive territory has shaped an elegant expression of Nerello Mascalese (with 20% Nerello Cappuccio) offering aromas of wild berry set against delicately toasted pistachio nut. In the mouth, the wine is silky, compact and very persistent."
"Another stellar effort from this terrific new winery. Luscious aromasâ€”stone fruits, candy, wax, peel, honey, cumin, allspiceâ€”it just keeps on going. Firm in the mouth, with the same exotic and refined blend of interesting spices and fruits. A tour de force."
"Awesome. A superior California Syrah, one of the finest of the vintage. Although it's dry, it's massive in blackberry and blueberry pie filling fruit, with interesting complexities of smoked meats, black pepper, minerals from the earth, cola and sandalwood. Just delicious now, and should hold in the bottle over the next six years."
"Big, full-bodied wine, the great tannins dominating the underlying red fruit. It's firmly concentrated, intense, a powerhouse of dense texture and obviously a wine that will need aging. Give it 5â€“6 years."
"Very dense wine, its tannins solid and concentrated. The structure is the leader here, with the young fruit showing through as black plum skins and crushed strawberries. This is a firmly tannic wine, needing aging."
"A super-structured, incredibly textured Syrah from the Sierra Foothills, this is Bill Easton's best of the best lots, aptly named Ascent, that he puts out every year to showcase his deft handling of age-worthy Syrah. This one will continue to develop its earthy, dusty, bacon fat and cigar box qualities over time. A truly beautiful bottle of wine."
"Beautiful lemon-scented wine, balancing rich butter and apricot flavors with intense, pure acidity. The wine at this stage is toast and fruit, still coalescing into its long-term future."
"The aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the wood flavors on the palate. However, it's the powerful sweet black cherry and red berry fruit flavors, layered with fruit tannins and acidity, that are driving this impressive wine. For aging at least six years."
"Lots of toasty oak on this Pinot, but also plenty of rich, unctuous fruit to support it. Shows ample flavors of cloves, cinnamon, ripe wild cherries, and earthy, forest floor notes of balsam and dried pine needles. The texture is lightly delicate and silky, with crisp acidity. Really shows off the Clos Pepe terroir in a delightful way."
"Unusually blended from all five Bordeaux varieties with Malbec dominating, this is a wonderfully, rich, complex wine. It shows jammy blackberry and plum flavors, with spice and cocoa overtones and firm, ripe tannins. The finish is dry and long. An impressive introductory wine from Trefethen, off the estate vineyard."
"This vintage the wine is comprised of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. It's a deeper, darker, richer wine than the '07, with which it was co-released, and equally high-scoring. Almost sweetly jammy in black cherries, raspberries, cola and caramelized oak, it's rescued by firm tannins and a finish that dries it out in minerals and spices. Nowâ€“2016."
"Supple, dark, and laced with licorice, cassis, and clove, this well-crafted Bordeaux blend does not scream high alcohol, though it tops 14.6%. What keeps it focused and precise are the vivid acids and sculpted tannins. It's the work of a young winemaker who is improving dramatically with each new vintage, even as his vineyard puts out better and better fruit."
"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward."
"Wide open and seductive, this brings together grapes from both Conner Lee (northern Columbia Basin) and Champoux (Horse Heaven Hills). Muscular, ripe and round, the sweet blackberry and cassis fruit is limned with a granite-like minerality. Great concentration and layeringâ€”a berry/rock/tannin layer cake."
"This particular bottling belongs with the very best Syrahs from this Syrah-infatuated state. A broad, toasty, full-bodied and fully realized wine, it has begun to smooth out from the extra years in bottle, but has a long life ahead. Berries, cherries, chocolate, coffee, mocha, tobacco, fungus, graphiteâ€¦ the flavors go and go."
"Full bodied and concentrated without being overly heavy or tannic, this is a stunning blend of Shiraz (92%) and Viognier (8%). Hints of roasted or grilled meat and black olive balance the bold blackberry fruit, leaving behind a lingering finish of warmth and dusty cocoa. Drink nowâ€“2020."
"As always, Beringer's Alluvium blend is a complex white wine, meant to pair with good food. The '08 is comprised of Sauvignon Blanc, SÃ©millon, Chardonnay and Viognier. It's fruity, crisp and dry."
Campo Magri is a bright and lively Valpolicella Superiore with crisp tones of cherry and wild berry backed by slight smoke and spice. The natural acidity will cut through the density or ossobuco or beef stew.
"This vineyard-designate Ripasso opens with dark concentration and lush aromas of mature fruit, spice, leather, chocolate and dried beef or cured ham. This is a rich and velvety wine that could stand up to barbecued short ribs smothered in spicy sauce."
"Fabiano's newest Ripasso opens with bright cherry aromas followed by spice, clove, black pepper and pressed rose petal. The wine boasts a soft, steady feel in the mouth and relatively smooth texture overall."
"Instead of brawn and muscle, this ruby Ripasso offers elegance and finesse. The nose is redolent of polished black stone, Indian spice and loads of dried cassis and wild berry. There's a playful hint of sweet almond and cinnamon at the end."
"Another fine effort in a continuing series of outstanding PGs from Hogue. This is tart and stylish, loaded with citrus and bracingly acidic. Flavors meld lemon, lime, lemon verbena, orange peel and a slice of pear."
"A little on the soft side, but very dry, with smoky oak and blackberry fruit dominating. Feels good and chewy and rich, with interesting herb and spice notes. Will age for a few years, but not for a long time. Give it a good decant."
Ripasso Il Vegro offers a rich and meaty bouquet with aromas of cured beef and honey roasted ham. There are also bright fruit tones of cherry and blackberry and the wine adds a crisp touch of sour cranberry at the very end.
"Tapteil, Ciel and Cara Mia vineyard fruit, a blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Young and tight, with the characteristic Cadence chalk and stone undertone. The fruit is pretty strawberry, with a peppery herbal streak, good length and fine balance."
"Campo LeÃ²n is a jammy, chewy wine with raw notes of black cherry, Indian spice, cedar wood and melted chocolate. It's thick, syrupy and it's hard to imagine a balanced food pairing outside succulent red meat."
"This is a smooth and rich Amarone with equal parts jammy fruit set against a smokey oak component. The wine slides nicely over the palate with a lavish, velvety texture and imparts more oak spice and mesquite on the close."
"A lively, balanced wine at an accessible price point, Marquee's 2008 Signature Chard boasts aromas of smoke, vanilla and stone fruit and flavors that follow along similar lines, with white peach and pineapple coming to the fore. Drink nowâ€“2012."
"A bit mulchy and swampy for Manso, with earthy tobacco and generic berry fruit aromas. The palate is flush and a little heavy, with creamy flavors of vanilla, dill weed and cassis. Soft and sweet late, with chunkiness and a medium to basic structure. A very good wine but not great as in past years."
"Classic, soft, easy and broad Pinot Blanc. There is an attractive buttery character to go with the peach and lime flavors. The wine is ripe, with pure fruit and a final tang of acidity."
"This is a powerful but not exaggerated style of Amarone that delivers ripe cherry and blackberry aromas followed by new leather, cigar box, spice and rum cake. It imparts a very smooth, rich and supple feel."
"A 70-30 blend of Corvina and Rondinella, this bright Amarone offers simple but genuine aromas of forest berry, toasted almond, cherry cola and vanilla bean. The wine is smooth, polished and crisp on the close."
"This Riserva Amarone shows a meaty, bold, sweet and jammy personality with loads of aromatic intensity. It's almost too much of a good thing with overripe flavors of prune and berry marmalade."
"The best Paso a Paso white yet; it's ripe and smells of pineapple and melon, while the palate is pure and has a solid feel. Flavors of apple, peach and pithy citrus are honest, and the finish is clean. Delivers what it should and more."
"From a cooler region than its Bin 28 stablemate, Penfolds' 2007 Bin 128 is a medium-bodied Shiraz that features touches of peppery spice, raspberry-cherry fruit and a darker edge of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are supple without being soft, giving this a drinking window that should extend through 2017 or so."
"A beautiful Syrah. It's very dry and softly tannic, with complex blackberry, black cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Could be firmer in structure, but a lovely wine to drink now."
"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor. This bottling is, of course, one of the most ageable in California, but the inherent imbalance seems to mitigate against long time in the cellar."
"Smoky, rubbery and sweet on the nose, with mocha and caramel shadings. The palate, however, is more tight and narrow; the feel is fresh and blazing, while the flavors are piercing and suggest red fruits like cranberry and cherry. Citric but with just enough weight to register as true Cabernet (with 18% CarmenÃ¨re and 7% Cab Franc)."
"Bold and spicy, with a lot of cinnamon, licorice and toasty aromas. Quite intense in the mouth, where black cherry, toast and vanilla flavors lead the charge. The finish is tangy and long, with coffee and citrus accents coming along late in the game. Made from whole berries fermented in open-top vats."
"An interesting and unsual wine for Chile. Hailing from grafted vines originally planted to Chenin Blanc in 1956, this Viognier is superfloral, with oily aromas along with apple blossom, nectarine and apricot. The palate has nice natural acidity and sweet flavors of melon, mango and citrus. A little big and unfocused and sweet, but still intriguing and nicely made."
"Corte San Benedetto is a small, family run winery and its 2003 Amarone shows ripe notes of black cherry, mesquite, blackberry and soft vanilla. The oak element is evident here; the wine is soft and supple on the close."
"Loads of aromatic intensity comes through on the bouquet with lovely layers of ripe cherry, spice, mesquite wood, Indian spice and cola. The oak element is evident here and will integrate with a bit more time in the bottle. In the mouth, this rich, ruby-colored wine offers jammy fruit and soft, velvety texture."
"A mature, serious wine, showing toasty flavors that are rounding out the fruit. A definite food wine, its richness tempered with a bite of acidity and delicious final crispness."
"Here's a new producer from Valpolicella who presents a sharp and angular Amarone with fine aromas of spice, wild berry, black tobacco and tea leaf. The wine is bright and compact with soft tannins and natural freshness."
"Rich and spicy, this is a fine, dry, peppery Pinot Gris. In the mouth there's weight and ripeness, as well as some fat, yellow fruits. There's a touch of lychee as well, giving an exotic edge to the finish."
"A lot of olive and herbs upfront, with cumin and other exotic, arguably unusual aromas. The palate is soft and a little low on structure, but the flavors are big and sweet, almost overripe and syrupy. There's cola, blackberry, coffee and mulchy herbal flavors from start to finish. A big wine that needs to be drunk now; it's not going to get better."
"With light toast aromas, this is a wine that shows vanilla from wood aging more than its fruitiness. There is a barnyard edge to it that brings out rusticity. On the finish, acidity does bring some freshness."
"Structure keeps this firm, dry wine solidly closed. It is tightly wound at this stage, only hinting at a brighter, fruity future. Drink after 2015."
"Sweet oak and rich cherry jam combine to make this blend distinctly candied in nature. It's a straightforward, simple with smooth tannins."
"This wine is mostly Grenache, with about one-third Syrah blended in. There are pleasant cherry and blackberry flavors on the palate, but also a mushroomy streak that distracts. It's not likely to improve with age so drink up."
"Harsh in mouthfeel, this Cab has cherry, black currant and wintergreen mint flavors, wrapped into firm but fine tannins. For the price, it's not bad for everyday fare."
"This is a candied Pinot with flavors of pink bubblegum, raspberries and strawberries. Give it some time in the glass and drink up."
"The fruit flavors never get past light, tart cranberry in this wine, and there is an earthy tinge that runs through the palate and into the finish. It's thin and tannic in style."
"This rustic Cabernet has pretty good varietal flavors of blackberries and dried currants, enhanced with an oaky sweetness. It's full bodied and tannic, and fine for drinking now."
"This value Pinot Noir is perfectly fine for everyday drinking, with a light, silky texture framing raspberry and oak flavors."
"Recuerdo is the house brand from the Vines of Mendoza project, which is relying on young Tupungato vineyards that expand annually. This vintage shows floral berry aromas along with Middle East spice notes of cumin and curry. In the mouth, it's sharp and hollow, like an elevator that skips floors. Clipped flavors of boysenberry are acidic, while the finish lacks substance."
"Made with Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Barbera, Merlot and Cabernet, this wine opens with dominant oak aromas that carry through to the palate alongside subdued notes of prune and fig. It lacks fruit richness and freshness to support the oak."
"This wine has a lean side that takes away from the bright acidity and fruitiness. With its berry fruit flavors, it should be rich, but lacks a middle."
"A strong pineapple and mango imprint persists throughout this Chardonnay, along with bright acidity and a floral finish."
"Made from one of Port's best grapes, this wine is sweet and simple. It has sugary raspberry and vanilla flavors, with a sting of heat from high alcohol."
"A scent of fusel oil mixes into this lightly fruity wine, along with citrus rind and hints of almond."
"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this blend of half Merlot along with four other Bordeaux grape varieties brings notes of toast, bittersweet chocolate, citrus and cranberry. It's tart and puckering with tightly wound tannins that need time to resolve."
"This isn't the most complicated Pinot Noir, but it is a clean, easy-drinking wine. With raspberry and cherry flavors wrapped into a silky texture, it will be fine to drink with burgers."
"With sweet oak, buttered toast, vanilla, pineapple and mango flavors, this is an easy Chardonnay to drink now. The price is good for a Chard this rich and creamy."
"This wine is medium bodied with spicy, brambly wild berry and tobacco flavors, as well as heady alcohol. It shows some unbalanced green notes. Drink now."
"At this price, and with a case production of 110,000, lots of Americans will consider themselves lucky to have a solid red wine like this. It's not terribly complicated, but offers easy flavors of cherries and oak."
"Soft, fruity and juicy, this is a pleasant, simple wine that is a blend from different European countries. It is balanced and very drinkable for parties or barbecues. Screwcap."
"Peach and apple aromas are modest. The palate is juicy and citric in feel, while flavors of melon, apple and nectarine finish tangy, with a citrusy taste."
"Light, bright and fruity, this wine is full of citrus acidity and a ripe, herbaceous character. Lively and fresh, it is a Sauvignon-dominated wine."
"This wine seems thin and rather tight. It has as much acidity as it does fruit, and a dry tannic structure. Not a wine for aging."
"Full-bodied and firm, this dark-fruited Shiraz an be consumed now with rare beef or lamb, or cellared 2â€“3 years. Cola and blackberry fruit dominate, with notes of chocolate and cedar chiming in on the finish."
"Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations. It's not too extracted or oaky but instead delivers robust blackberry, plum and caramel flavors backed by a warm, mildly oaky finish with menthol and mocha. Drink now into 2010."
"This is beautiful, herbaceous Sauvigon Blanc, the signature grape of Styria, in a fine, ripe version, all rich fruits, green apple juice, fresh berries and lively acidity. Glass stopper."
"A ripe, fragrant wine that also manages to retain fine crispness. There is some GrÃ¼ner pepper and spice, but the freshness of the wine allows it to show grapefruit and other citrus characters as well as tense acidity."
"Fresh but rich, this young wine has structured edges, great purity of green currant fruits as well as fine concentration. The roundness of the palate is matched by its delicious acidity. Glass stopper."
"The flavors of this Pinot, made from pre-Dijon clone Martini selection vines, are fine. They range from cherries and cola to sweet cured tobacco and buttered cinnamon toast to smoky vanilla. If the wine had a crisper, livelier mouthfeel, it would score a lot higher."
"This is spicy and varietally specific, with sharp, tight, bright red berry flavors and a peppery finish. Made in a forward, fruit-powered style, it should be enjoyed while the youthful exuberance is there in full bloom. In   the very back of the finish are hints of smoked meat."
"The blend is 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 18% Petit Verdot and 10% Cabernet Franc. The result is a medium-bodied, softly textured red wine with flavors of black cherries, tobacco and vanilla that finishes velvety smooth. Drink now."
"Coeur d'Alene Cellars does a fine job with Syrah. This has much the same satiny, sexy black fruit as the more expensive Opulence bottling, but it is more accessible and forward, with less power in the back end. Still, it's quite delicious, and the smoky tannins add some extra authority."
"Typical Beaune in its round, soft character. If the tannins are not particularly powerful, it still shows a generous nature, with super-ripe fruits supported by some dryness. The finish is jammy, ripe, a salad of red berries."
"A dark and richly spicy wine, with penetrating varietal scents of pepper and berry. The wine is tart and youthful, and along with the tangy flavors of berry and spice there is a layer of graphite and a hint of cured meat reaching into the finish. It's sappy, racy and bright, but also layered and showing ageworthy potential. Tannins just hint at green tea."
"This single-vineyard GrÃ¼ner is powerful, with concentrated white fruit flavors, floral aromas and great, crisp, fresh acidity. The fruit is ripe, hinting at creamy, with a soft green aftertaste. Screwcap."
"This is a welcome return for this value Merlot after the 2004 vintage was skipped. The smooth and chocolaty flavors that consumers love are there, but they have been pulled back, letting more of the cherry fruit and subtle accents of forest floor, fungus and earth show through. It's textural, complex and thoroughly enjoyable."
"Tomero is a new line from the Carlos Pulenta group, and this one sings the tale of Salta with sincerity. You get telling acacia and lychee aromas, but none of the cheap perfume that can sometimes ruin the variety. The palate is lightly oily but linear, while the papaya, citrus and melon flavors just roll along."
"An intense, forward style of Malbec. The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish. A bit acidic and racy, but that won't hurt it if served with food."
"Too bad the vineyard owner is pulling out the Sauvignon Blanc, because this is a fresh, vibrant, juicy one, crisp in acidity and rich in citrus, figs, pears and melons. Just a touch of tart gooseberry shows up in the finish."
"No surprise that Willi BrÃ¼ndlmayer is one of the few in Austria to have real success with Pinot Noir. This is soft, ripe, enveloping, with bitter cherry flavors rounded at the edges with sweet tannins and refreshing acidity."
"Here's a Cab that needs food to round it off and polish its rough edges. Very dry and a bit angular in tannins, with a peppery bite and generous flavors of cherries and blackberries."
"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mÃ©lange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating."
"Torres' Celeste debuted in 2003, and the '05 is the best vintage to date. The wine has penetrating berry and spice aromas and an accent of animal leather. The palate is healthy and polished, with plum, blackberry and herbal notes. Comes together well and should be good in the cellar through 2012."
"A solid effort that delivers all the buttery, creamy and fruity flavors most consumers love. Clean and vibrant in mouthwatering acidity, it's rich in pineapple, orange and spicy pear flavors."
"At only $12 per bottle, this is a solid value. The aromas are slightly dusty, like dried rose petal, while the flavors suggest mixed berries and dry earth, with a hint of black tea on the finish. Tannins are silky. Drink now."
"Fresh and reasonably fruity on the nose, but it's also slightly gritty and tough. Shows medium weight and intensity in the mouth, with a medicinal red-berry flavor accented by spice and herb notes. It finishes dry and mildly oaky."
"A blackened wine, with piercing, dense aromas of shoe polish, charred oak, dark spice and black fruit. It feels solid and juicy, with black-tasting flavors that focus on espresso and dark spice. The finish is a bit short on fruit."
"This blend of 88% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Cabernet Franc is rustic smelling, with a rubbery, tannic mouthfeel and flavors of roasted plum and berry. Let this wine aerate to show its best."
"Attractive spicy wine with a lively, lightly spicy character. It is rich without being heavy, showing acidity while also having a smooth texture on the finish."
"This has some light deposits at the bottom of the bottle, with a slightly cloudy appearance. Aromas of stone fruit, melon and citrus create a broad and thick aromatic front."
"There's a touch of burnt almond at the start, but this bright effort soon picks up speed thanks to delicate aromas of honey, cantaloupe and white peach. This is smooth and creamy on the finish."
"Fresh, with an attractive line of acidity that complements the spice and rich texture. It's dry on the finish, remaining crisp and ripe. This is a real food wine."
"This is fruity as a pastry, with flavors of nougat, blackberry and cherry jam, toasted almond and honey. Modern in style, the texture is soft, with melted tannins."
"Black in color, this wine has reduced aromas of blueberry, cumin and bitter chocolate. Thick and generous in the mouth, but also rugged, with sweet blackberry and bacon flavors and a lot of toasty-oak influence."
"Prima Volta (â€œfirst timeâ€) is a fresh and easy wine, with medium intensity and bright aromas of honey, peach and white flower. The mouthfeel is lean and compact, but the persistent perlage keeps it lively."
"Packaged in a pocket-friendly 187-ml bottle, this is fragrant and simple, with tonic, creamy foam and bright aromas of peach, honeydew and jasmine."
"A genuine, honest sparkler, this has simple tones of almond paste and lemon soda. The mouthfeel is held steady by foamy cream and bright effervescence."
"This sparkler opens with tonic, almost steely perlage that tickles the nose. The bouquet is comprised of crushed stone and white peach, and there's a distant hint of honey at the close."
The simple bouquet is dominated by white rose and peach blossom aromas. This shows a nice quality of creamy effervescence as well.
"This is simple, showing dry tones of crushed stone and white peach. There is some softness in the mouth thanks to the creamy quality of the wine's foamy bubbles."
"Direct and immediate, this crisp effort shows pretty balance between its sweet fruit and zesty citrus elements. A perfect summer-sipping sparkling wine."
"At first this shows some earthy, volatile aromas. The mineral-driven palate has tart, slightly bitter fruit flavors, suggesting crabapple and wild berry."
"Toasty, caramelized oak dominates the aroma and flavor of this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend. It tastes soft and a little short of power."
"A nice, sophisticated Cabernet to drink now Dry and crisp in acidity, it has a solid framework of tannins, giving structure to the blackberry and currant flavors."
"Spice and cream dominate this attractive wine. With its full flavors of spice and pear, there is a also a hint of flower. An attractive wine that is developing quickly."
"Orange and mandarin flavors mark this warm, full-bodied wine. It's forward and fruity, showing a sweeter character, with vanilla and spice tones. Drink soon."
"Riper and fruitier than Donati's less expensive '08s, the Ezio is a Bordeaux-style blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. This swaps elegance for a more full-bodied, robust style that comes across as heavy."
"Solid on the bouquet, this has notes of dark fruit and smoke, with an almond-like sweetness. Big, bulky and bullish in the mouth, it has roasted, meaty flavors that include campfire smoke, flamed meat and black fruit. The finish tastes charred but feels healthy and lively."
"This is one of several estates in this cru appellation where Georges Duboeuf makes and markets the wine. It is lightly wood aged to smooth out the ebullient fruits. Rich and with some firm tannins that will develop, it has concentration and a dense texture. Drink from 2018."
"This cru estate is owned by the Duboeuf family. The wine has some wood aging that adds to the rich texture while not detracting from the ripe juicy red-cherry fruit. With its tannins, the wine could age, so drink from late 2017."
"From the south-east facing CÃ´te du Py, this is a powerfully structured wine. It is as full of tannins as of ripe red fruits. The wine with its dense character it likely to age well over several years. Drink from 2018."
"Owned by the Darroze family, the cru wine from this estate is produced by Georges Duboeuf. It is a dense wine with balancing rich black fruits. Its spicy cherry-fruit flavor and rich tannins give a wine that should age further. Drink from 2018."
"This is an estate-grown blend of 61% Malbec, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Petit Verdot and 3% Syrah. It sizzles in a mix of huckleberry and blueberry, full-bodied and dusty in tannin. Its juicy and lifted by moderate acidity, with oaky accents of vanilla, nutmeg and clove."
"Made with 50% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Syrah and 5% Petit Verdot, this has subdued aromas suggesting underbrush, clove, dark-skinned berry and French oak. The smooth vibrant palate delivers red currant, unripe cherry, mocha and dried sage alongside fine-grained tannins. An orange zest note closes the finish."
"First made during the Reagan-Gorbachev years, this blend of 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay tastes of hazelnut torte and almond paste, offering richness interwoven with moderate acidity. On the lusherside of the sparkling spectrum, it offers a sweetness of peach, brown sugar and lemon meringue."
"Mossy freshness and fragrance appear on the shy subdued nose. The wonderfully slender and sprightly palate is fresh and delicate. There is something subtle and lithe about this, which is very uplifting. The finish is refreshing and clean."
"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up over 70% of this blend with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It shows aromas of dark cherries, licorice and brooding black fruit that at times seems slightly dried out. The palate shows elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
"This is quite a dynamic and layered wine, especially for the bargain price, with deep and hearty blackberry, caramel, rust, lavender and potpourri on the nose. The berry-led palate is rustic and unrefined, with feral flavors, peppery spice and decent acidity."
"Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018."
Ripe perfumed black fruits dominate this cru wine. They float above the firm tannins and concentrated acidity to offer a wine that will become rich and generous as it develops. A touch of pepper and spice adds to the layers of fruit. Drink from 2018
"Spice and green pepper notes accentuate ripe luscious blackberry and cassis flavors in this classically inspired Cabernet Franc. Fine tannins and fresh cutting acidity lend vibe to the midpalate. Fleshy and ripe yet pleasantly herbaceous, it's ready to drink now but should hold well through 2022."
"This wine seems broad across the palate, but not quite as deep as some Condrieus. The fruit is understated, resembling gently toasted marshmallow and maybe a touch of baked pineapple, rather than flamboyant apricot and spice. Plan on serving it with fish or chicken rather than something rich or extravagant."
"This wine is big in tannin, extracted and full bodied, with dense blueberry and maple syrup at its core. For fans of a rich style, it will impress for  its ripe, dark fruit and sizable yet velvety mouthfeel."
"This blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Cinsault would be a crowd favorite if more than 700 cases were available in the U.S. The black cherry fruit is punched up by hints of herbs and cracked pepper, there's ample weight but great freshness and zest, and the finish is long and complex, showing off hints of licorice, pepper and dusty earth. Drink nowâ€“2020."
"Ripe and round, this offers enticing scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and a whiff of pressed powder. The big juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, raspberry star anise and chopped herb alongside chewy tannins."
"This smooth, lean red attractively delivers above its price point. Tart in clove and currant, it finishes with a whiplash of mocha."
"A slightly earthy nose of yellow plum and stone fruit leads to a fresh textured palate, which shows off mirabelles and lemons. There is a pleasant phenolic edge and a clean, long finish."
"The dark red fruit is enveloped in the rounded, rich and chocolaty scent of oak. The palate shows a lighter side with delicate fruit of a red-cherry nature. Freshness sumptuous oak and red-cherry notes marry well. This is lovely now, but just a few more months in bottle will allow it to knit together more. Drink now through 2020."
A four-acre parcel of old vines is the source of this dense and rich wine. It has jammy red berry and cherry fruits that are lifted by the mineral texture and acidity. The wine is balanced although it does need to age. Drink from the end of 2017.
"Cassis, bell pepper, toast, French oak and coconut lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the tightly wound palate along with raw red currant, powdered sage, licorice and a confectionery note. Close-grained tannins leave a rather astringent finish."
A subdued nose leads onto a fresh easy-drinking palate that is characterized by generous spritz and ripe almost plump pear fruit that is just tempered by citrus freshness. This is so easy to drink and so refreshing with that spritz.
Very varietal aromas of sour cherry and cranberry lead to a fruit-filled flavorful palate. Light oak accents linger on the finish. It's a very pleasing example of the variety.
"This is an aromatic wine, with scents of green melon candy, lime zest, white flowers and white peach. It drinks off dry, with stone-fruit flavors brightened by zippy acidity leading to a mouthwatering finish."
"Concentrated flavors and a richly tannic texture make this dry wine more sophisticated and interesting than many other red blends. It combines cranberry, black cherry and cinnamon notes for a mouthfilling and harmonious impression."
"With a perfumed nose of rose and toasted oak, this wine is thick in red fruit, dense oak and a welcome undercurrent of bright acidity that helps keep it fresh in the glass. Small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec are all within."
"Inviting aromas of dark-skinned fruit, blue flower, leather and a whiff of baking spice waft out of the glass. The firm juicy palate offers ripe wild cherry, licorice and hint of charcuterie while assertive, seasoned tannins provide support. Drink through 2021."
"Golden caramelized oak supports a fleshy, full-bodied sensation of pear and fig in this bold, rich wine. Resolved on the palate and possessed of moderate acidity, it finishes in a plume of nutmeg."
"Creamy, lush and somewhat robust, this dry sparkler offers a thick mousse and touch of richness in its mix of nutty bread dough, green apple, pear and lime."
"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now."
"Scratchy plum and raspberry aromas are fresh and forward, while the mouthfeel follows suit; it's juicy, with narrowing acidity and brightness. Flavors of raspberry, plum and cherry end zesty and long, with crisp acidity maintaining focus. This is a blend of Carignan (Mazuelo), Garnacha and Syrah."
"Though not indicated on the label, once again the Morrison Lane vineyardâ€”the oldest Syrah planting in Walla Wallaâ€”is the source of the fruit. The wine is peppery and tannic, with cherry fruit and dried herbal accents. There's a whiff of toast in the finish."
"This straightforward, perfectly clean blend of Carignan, Syrah and Garnacha would function as a great everyday house red. It's lively and a little racy and grating on the palate, with standard, fresh berry flavors touched up by a sprinkle of chocolaty oak. A modest finish keeps the vibe positive."
Sweet peach nectar and fragrant white flower open the nose of this lush GewÃ¼rztraminer. The wine feels slightly sweet and sticky on the palate with rich density and a waxy finish.
"Sourced from dry farmed, organic vines planted in 1918, Carol Shelton's Monga is a mouthful of a wine, layered with cinnamon spice, blueberry, chocolate and oak, and still very concentrated and dry, with room to grow and mellow."
"This is a big, modern, warm Garnacha with a lot of oak and vanilla on the bouquet as well as blackberry and cassis. It's jammy on the tongue, but there's enough acidity to keep the pulse up. Dark black cherry, berry and rubbery flavors are followed by end-notes of raisin, chocolate and vanilla."
"This red blend from Umbria offers a decadent bouquet that consists of rich chocolate and bright cherry intensity. The wine is smooth and chewy with a plush, velvety texture."
"A solid, ripe, juicy black fruited wine, delicious already with its fragrant fruits. It has structure that supports the attractive surface, giving shape to this lightly textured wine. Keep for 4â€“5 years, but also drink now."
"A delightfully clean and fruity wine, the epitome of Provence rosÃ©. It has fresh acidity, crisp lemon and red currant fruit and just a light sprinkling of spice."
"Stalky wine, its black currant fruits tight and still developing. It has a juicy character that comes from the intense youthful acidity and that will blend over the next 4â€“5 years."
"Polished and pretty, this Merlot delivers plenty of juicy cherry, red currant, mocha and toast flavors that are lovely to drink now. The wine is smooth and softly tannicâ€”just what you want Merlot to be."
"This wine is a little direct, but very tasty, showing rich, ripe cherry, red currant, cocoa and sweet oak flavors, wrapped into lovely tannins. A polished, pretty wine for drinking now."
"This dry, tannic wine is astringent now, in the way of a young Cabernet. It has a heart of ripe blackberries and currants, and finishes dry and clean. There's a rustic edge that  suggests drinking over the next 2â€“3 years."
"With damp earth and crusty leather aromas, this is a heavy wine with baked fruit, a syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of mocha, carob, leafy berry and earth. On the finish, it's full bodied and soft, with ripe black-fruit flavors that register as thick and a touch raisiny. Drink now."
"Masses of sweet blackberry jam give this Cabernet an easy deliciousness. The fruit and oak are balanced with fine tannins and a gentle scour of acidity. Not one for the cellar, but it will benefit from an hour or two in the decanter."
Pecorino is a fascinating white grape from Central Italy that deserves a special look. This expression bursts open with tones of acacia flower and stone fruit and delivers medium density and richness on the finish.
"This fine-honed Chardonnay hews to the Eyrie house style. It may seem austere at first, but the green and yellow fruit flavors are ripe, not vegetal, and the firm acidity makes it a fine food match. Give it plenty of time to breathe before serving."
"This RhÃ´ne-style blend is fruity and delicious. It has raspberry, cherry, licorice, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into easy tannins, brightened with a bite of lime acidity. Ready to enjoy now."
"Thea Riserva opens with dark and austere notes of black licorice, tar, black cherry and crushed granite. There's a dusty quality to the close followed by a dry but fresh finish."
"Shows the dark color, thick tannins and deep, concentrated flavors you expect from Petite Sirah. It's a big gulp of blackberry jam, espresso, dark chocolate and crushed black pepper, and the finish is thoroughly dry. Lacks the acidic vibrancy needed for aging, but a fine wine to drink now."
"Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately."
"A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune. The blending both softens and expands the mid-palate, and seems to have boosted the aging curve. It's ready to drink, with strawberry fruit, a dusting of cocoa, a hint of wet cement, and a finish with cola and sassafras."
"Frankly delicious, offering wave after wave of black cherry jam, red currant, licorice, mocha, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast flavors, wrapped into soft, smooth tannins."
"Rotgipfler is almost an exclusivity to Thermenregion. This bright, fruity wine is deliciously crisp with spice, pepper and pear flavors. It has a light lemon edge brought out by the refreshing acidity. Screwcap."
"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings."
"The nose sends up signals of a balanced, easygoing wine with oak blended nicely into pear and apple fruit. The palate is lively and mildly oaky, with baked apple, orange and woodspice flavors. A snappy, oaky finish with intense acidity closes the show."
"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray."
"This is a good value for a sophisticated Merlot from Napa Valley. It's not an ager, but it's delightful now for its dryness, smooth tannins and complex cherry and red currant flavors with hints of herbs and sweet peas."
There's a dark and masculine quality to this Sangiovese from Romagna that makes this wine perfect for pork or breaded veal. Dark cherry and prune are backed by bright acidity.
"A gentle wine, this has warm, fruity aromas, ripe red cherry and raspberry flavors, a soft texture and fine-grained tannins. Medium to full bodied and almost sweet in balance, it's easy to enjoy."
"A mix of Sauvignon Blanc (77%) and SÃ©millon, this wine comes from three separate vineyards in the Columbia Valley. It shows plenty of Sauvignon's herbal character while also displaying the ripeness of the vintage, with lightly spritzy tropical fruit and fig flavors that possess a fleshy feel."
"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with green, reedy aromas along with notes of cranberry and cherry Jolly Rancher. The full-bodied palate delivers more but seems disconnected with tart, tangy cranberry flavors."
"Aromas of toast, oak, espresso and a whiff of smoke lead the nose. The palate offers oak extract, coconut, coffee and vanilla but there's not enough fruit richness to support the oak. It's already reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later."
"A stamp of smoke and toasted oak mark the entry into this wine, followed by chewy tannins that wrap themselves around dark layers of chocolate and tobacco leaf, the structure at first impenetrable. The finish is relaxed and somewhat short."
"This lightly colored wine blends Grenache (43%), Syrah (32%) and MourvÃ¨dre. It brings aromas of red raspberries, currant and flowers. The palate is fresh and lighter in style, with the emphasis on fruit."
"There are flavors of peanuts as well as the more usual white fruits in this wine that is rounded and soft, with gentle acidity. The wine, fresh at the end, is ready to drink."
"This tradition-bucking blend of 61% Chenin Blanc, 31% Viognier and 8% Roussanne offers soft aromas of sweet apple blossoms and peach, with a hint of barrel smoke. The palate offers a similar blend of peaches, pears and apples, warmed up with some oak influence."
"Aromas of toast, milk chocolate and black-skinned fruit lead the way. The soft, low-acid palate doles out crushed plum, fleshy cherry and mocha alongside drying, angular tannins that create an abrupt finish."
"A strong oak influence dampens the varietal character in this full-bodied, spicy wine. It smells like cinnamon and cedar, tastes slightly sweet and smoky, is full bodied and rich in texture. Nice and smooth, it shows only mild varietal character."
"This is a substantial wine, concentrated in dark red berry color and flavor, from cherry to wild strawberry to more savory rhubarb compote. Muted on the nose, it has an underlying woody, herbal character that balances the vibrancy of the fruit."
"If only this wine wasn't extracted so much (which gives bitterness), it would be ripe and fruity. As it is, it's hard to get past the tight, dry tannins. There are hints of juiciness and black currant fruits. It might soften by 2016."
"This crisp, fruity wine has delicious acidity. Gray-pink in color, it is ripe with red berries that also impart attractive freshness. The wine is crisp, tangy and textured at the end."
"This blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of forest floor, ripe blackberry, cedar and menthol. The warm, evolved palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, mint, ground pepper and a gamy note alongside assertive, almost gritty tannins that leave an astringent finish."
"Flavors of berry, vanilla and tar form around thick, rich tannins, giving this wine a puckering quality that may benefit from opening before enjoying. The finish is sturdy and robust in leathery black pepper."
"Here's a bright, informal red that offers sour cherry, red berry and a light note of cooking spice. Lively acidity and soft, rather fleeting tannins give it an easy-drinking quality."
"This 100% Merlot offers a lot of heat around its otherwise approachable lift of soft, smooth tannins and reasonable oak. Sage, cedar and tobacco provide a weedy aspect to the wine, offset by plenty of ripe blackberry and cherry."
"Grown in the southern section of the valley in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, this rare varietal bottling from this appellation shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry and citrus, along with some hints of oxidation. It's tart and full in feel, not seeming entirely varietally correct."
"This is an aromatically brooding wine with notes of herbs, pepper and brown spices. It drinks quite sweet with a lightly chalky feel."
"This is box wine taken seriously, even featuring a picture of winemaker Denise Wordenon. Fresh-squeezed blueberry fruit mixes with black rocks, milk chocolate and cedar on the nose, followed by an easy-to-quaff juiciness on the lightly bodied palate. It's not very complex, but perfect for summer barbecues or car camping."
"Rough, animal-like aromas wrestle with piercing, fairly hot plum and berry scents. Rubbery, blackened, peppery plum and raspberry flavors finish oaky, mildly bitter and tannic."
"The nose here is not quite as clean-cut as it could be, while the palate shows a little more focus. Crisp and zesty, if a little short."
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of raisinated cherries, herbs, bittersweet chocolate and a whiff of barnyard. Medicinal flavors are backed by chalky tannins."
"At this scale (170,000 cases imported), the quality is remarkable. Leafy notes accent pink grapefruit aromas and flavors, coming together in a harmonious, easy-drinking finish."
"Rounded, soft and smoothly creamy, this is a ripe wine dominated by Pinot Meunier. It's an open wine, fruity and ready to drink."
"Well-crafted and fruity, this has a fresh character that allows room for red berry flavors. It's a ripe wine, keeping freshness while bringing in a warmer, caramel character."
"Earthy notes of saline and cheesy leather accent plum aromas on this tight number with rubbery tannins. Plum, cherry and herbal flavors carry some bitterness onto a finish with medicinal plum notes."
"Made with Sangiovese and a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of coconut, toast and oak-driven spice. The evolved palate offers coconut, clove and ground black pepper but the fruit richness has almost dried up entirely, leaving an astringent finish."
"Intense with acidity and young fruitiness, this wine needs some time. The potential of the white and citrus fruit is there, with an herbaceous character that needs to soften. Drink from late 2015."
"This wine made from Muscat Canelli grapes is slightly spritzy and sweet, pungent in apricot fuzz and grass, a mÃ©lange of tropical goodness from there on out. Mango, kiwi and pineapple fill the medium-weight waves of viscous texture, concluding in a vanilla-tinged, light, fresh finish."
"This is a traditional styleâ€”emphasizing earthy tannins and spicy fruit and is rough around the edgesâ€”but is a wine that would relish being partnered with sausages, salamis and hard cheeses. There is plenty of weight, the acidity coming from minerality and wood."
"Not many wines come from Bucelas today, as its vineyards get eaten up by the northern Lisbon suburbs. This Arinto-based wine suggests there should be some more of this ultra-crisp white, which bears a passing resemblance to a Vinho Verde in its super-fresh apple and grapefruit flavors."
"Pretty mineral notes recall chalk and dusty ash and provide depth and dimension to this fresh and fragrant white wine. There's not much fruit, but the wine pulls its own thanks to those mineral nuances and its crisp acidity."
"An attractive salmon pink-colored wine, very fresh, with bright red currant acidity, fleshed out with some caramel, raspberry and a dash of red apple skins texture."
"Molasses, smoked bacon, beef jerky and loads of clove and exotic spice come to mind. LamÃ¹ri is a pure expression of Nero d'Avola that also offers plum, prune and blackberry. Despite the mature fruit flavors, the wine has good acidity and crispness."
"This is a mineral-driven wine from the blackened slopes of Mount Etna with delicate shadings of pear, peach, jasmine and honeysuckle. The overall impression is one of eleganceâ€”thanks to the jasmine notes in particular. It's a very special wine. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers."
"With the wonderfully crisp acidity and bright, laser-pure fruit Edna Valley is known for, this Syrah, Grenache and Viognier blush offers a wealth of tasty raspberry, cherry, citrus fruit and spice flavors. Dry and clean, it shows California rosÃ© near its best."
"This blend is mainly Shiraz (50%) and Grenache (28%), which accounts for the wine's ample, plummy fruit flavors. Accents of grilled meat and slightly briary overtones add complexity, and the wine finishes dry and savory. Drink now-2012."
"Portugal's popular brand is a lively, fresh, spice- and dried fruit-flavored wine. There are flavors of pound cake and nutmeg surrounding a core of solid, firm tannins. Great with food, this is not for aging."
"Sturdy and hard in tannins, brisk in acids, this Pinot will benefit from a year or so in bottle. It's extremely dry, with earthy, balsam and mushroom-inspired flavors of blackberries, black cherries and cola."
"Light in color and texture, with a silky, airy mouthfeel, this Pinot has elegant flavors of cherries, anise, vanilla, Asian spices and smoky wood. It's a polished wine for drinking now."
"â€œCocinaâ€ means â€œthe kitchenâ€ in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine. It's stout, a bit reduced and tinny at first, but with air it turns into a nice, simple chunkster with plump baked-fruit flavors and a soft but structured chocolaty finish. Drink now."
"Here's an easy-going Salice Salentino (90% Negroamaro and 10% Malvasia Nera) with spice, cherry and cola notes that are weaved nicely together. There's harmony and elegance here and the wine leaves a spicy imprint on the close."
This neutral and mineral-driven Greco offers tones of white stone and dried flowers. The wine is lean and crisp with a thin but refreshing consistency. It would make an excellent companion to spicy Indian or Thai foods.
"Rubbery and smoky at first, with leather and berry fruit running secondary to the wine's more reduced qualities. But if given ten minutes to unwind, it shows wide black-fruit flavors, creaminess and finally some barrel-based resin. Gets better the more you work with it, but will always register as â€œoaky.â€"
"This 2005 Syrah from Morrison Lane seems a bit lackluster compared with previous efforts. This is smoky and tight, a tannic wine with flavors of lead pencil, green tea and earth. But the fruit is quite light, tart, and does not seem to sync up with the heaviness of the tannins."
"Picked late and fermented on native yeast, this Viognier brings some snap and spice to its scents and flavors. The lime and quinine quality recalls a good gin and tonic; it definitely leans to the herbal rather than the tropical side of Viognier, but is crisp and refreshing."
"Fazio makes the best of hot climate growing conditions and presents a well-composed Nero d'Avola that is enhanced by aromas of red apple, cassis, pomegranate and black cherry. There's good intensity here and some sweetness, although the mouthfeel is in no way heavy or thick."
"Smoky, cedary notes nicely complement the blueberry fruit in this McLaren Vale Shiraz. It's pretty full on the palate, with a slightly syrupy texture that extends the flavors through a mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2012."
"This is 100% Syrah from an excellent vineyard. It's chewy and even a bit salty in the mouth, with a mix of bell pepper and black pepper over streaks of berry and cassis. Most of the flavor is front-loaded, and the wine fades away into an earthy, fairly tannic finish."
"The bouquet here is very floral and intense: you'll get jasmine, honeysuckle, sweet apple, mango and other exotic fruits. The wine tastes clean, sweet and dense and has fragrant flavors that accompany you glass after glass."
"Another super Sauvignon Blanc that shows how well Lake County does with this variety. It's all about the citrus, fig and spicy melon flavors and the juicy acidity, which makes the wine so fresh and clean. Made from the MusquÃ© clone."
"Enormous in jammy apricot, peach, pineapple, Asian spice and sweet charred oak vanillins, this Burgundy-inspired Chard is a little sweet. But it provides enough acidity for balanced structure."
"A fresh, intriguing wine whose balance and depth suggest midterm aging. Golden in color, it's succulent in the flavors of peaches, pineapples, limes, almond biscotti and butterscotch, with fine acidity and a rich, honeyed finish. Give it until sometime in 2008 and for another couple of years."
"The second wine from Malhadinha Nova is lively and fruity, packed with red fruits, sweet strawberry flavors and easy, ripe texture. Drink now."
"With the '05, Bucklin is getting a handle on this old-vine field blend of two dozen varieties, which seems to do best in cooler years. It's a rustic-chic wine, with a brawny muscularity tamed by extreme dryness, and even though the alcohol is 15.6%, it doesn't feel too hot."
"Soft and fruity, this Bordeaux blend has a splash of Syrah. It's dry and grippy in tannins, and there's a dried herb edge to the blackberry fruit. Finishes polished and elegant, but the softness suggests early drinking."
"An unexpected combination perhaps, but it works to give a fresh, flavorful wine, with soft tannins, juicy fruit and flavors of red cherries and vanilla. Not complex, and ready to drink now."
"Fresh green-apple aromas and some ripe, mango flavors, this is well rounded, showing some acidity, but more of open, fresh fruits. This is a wine that will be perfect to drink over the next few months."
"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like."
"The wines of Backsberg have a distinctive, artistic quality to them that makes them ideal for collectors and drinkers who seek wines with style. This Pinotage has those qualities, with its layers of cinnamon and deep berry on the nose and smooth, integrated berry and smoke flavors. This is a real Pinotage so expect the rubbery smoke that goes along with itâ€”but it's also elegant, offering structure and complexity with a gentle touch."
"The grapes were grown on the Central Coast, mostly in Arroyo Grande, and the wine is characterized by vibrant acidity. There is an intense taste of raspberries, more usually found in a red variety like Grenache than a white wine, but Grenache Blanc consitutes nearly half the blend, along with Roussanne."
"This one takes on an orange tint, and the aromas are akin to chocolate, spice cake and even some baked beans. The palate is quite crisp and healthy, with berry fruit, citrus and length. A good wine with a racy, cleansing feel. It's not spectacular but it ranks highly among similar competitors."
"Thanks to its buoyant aromas of field flower, green apple, pear and dried sage leaf, you could definitely describe this as a multidimensional wine with noticeable elegance. There are musky, sweet fruit flavors on the finish."
"Schug's regular Pinot, as opposed to their Heritage Reserve, is a dependably village-style expression of easy-drinking, cool-climate Pinot Noir. The '06, like previous vintages, shows a silky, delicate texture framing cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a smoky vanilla edge of oak."
"A first bottle was obviously off. A second was better, although still lacking the complexity you want at this price. It was a young Cab, dry and tannic, with a core of cassis and cherries. A few years in the cellar should soften it."
"On a par with recent vintages, this four-year old Cab is soft and pleasant, with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors that are well oaked. The tannins are crunchy, but the wine isn't an ager. Best now through 2009."
"This is a dry Prosecco, meaning it is slightly sweeter than a brut or extra dry. Traditionally, Prosecco has this level of sugar, making it a very true rendition of what the wine is intended to taste like: Fresh peach, basil, pineapple, yellow apple and even an understated touch of banana come into play."
"One of the principle grapes of the Alentejo, AntÃ£o Vaz blends easily with the Arinto of neighboring Ribatejo. There is an attractive citrus element to this wood-aged wine, soft, open, but remaining fresh, the tropical fruit flavors well under control."
"The idea here is to present a more structured and sophisticated Brut with emphasis on the nutty tones and mature peach. The wine succeeds in this regard but the whole point of Prosecco is to be light and fun; this ultimately lacks those sharp, well-defined fruit tones you might expect."
"Here is a lighter, paler shade of Prosecco with opulent and cheerful soapy and herbal qualities (thanks to 10% Pinot Bianco) backed by lemon candy and polished mineral. Yellow apple and chalk are immediately recognizable. The mouthfeel is creamy and foamy with fresh crispness that is noticeable but not exaggerated."
"There's a sweetmeat, salty leatheriness to this Pinot, like beef jerky. Give it a year or so to mellow out and let the smoky oak integrate with the ripe cherry, cola and raspberry flavors. Decant for an hour or two if you pop it open now."
"Ginger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff. The palate shows ripe and sweet orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit, while the back end is lean and citrusy but far short of complex. Good in a standard way."
"A bit heavy handed, with lots of tannins and acidity, and the jammy cherry-berry fruit is in your face. It's made in a big, bold style that will appeal to fruit-forward fans."
"Year after year, the Yasmin line from Recanati proves itself to be a fantastic value, and the 2009s are no exception. This 60% Merlot-40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is fruit-driven but appropriately spiced with a lovely mocha-infused finish. The silky texture offers approachable, dusty tannins integrated throughout the medium-weight mouth."
"Perfect for a pairing with lasagna or meat cannelloni with bechamel sauce, this bright Chianti Classico has the natural acidity to cut though fatty food ingredients. The wine's aromas recall white cherry and raspberry."
"Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak."
"Teeters on the verge of complexity, with dry, spicy flavors of raspberries and cherries. Good Carneros acidity makes for a brisk mouthfeel. Should develop for a year or three in the bottle."
"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay. The nose is peachy, while the palate is spritzy and bouncy, with short, slightly creamy apple, melon and papaya flavors that are true to Xarello. Finishes smooth but a little flat."
"Avignonesi takes a traditionalists' approach to most of its wines, including this ruby-colored Rosso di Montepulciano. Slightly muddled aromas of cherry and dried raspberry mingle with tobacco, leather and spice."
"Here's a fresh and lively unoaked Chard that's perfect for lighter fare like tabouleh salad or grilled chicken. Green apple and citrus mingle with a hint of lemon custard on the nose, while the medium-weight mouth offers more green plum and white nectarine flavors. Flavorful and refreshing; drink now."
"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited."
"A plump, nicely concentrated Sauvignon Blanc, the 2009 Mount Beautiful doesn't have the most intense aromatics, but is holding on to its weighty melon and fig flavors and lingering citrus finish. Drink up."
"Sangiovese is enhanced by small percentages of Malvasia Nera and Colorino to deliver a plush, plump and satisfying Morellino from southern Tuscany. There's a nice feeling of informality here that makes this wine perfect for easy meals with family and friends."
"At first taste, the tannins dominate. Then fresher fruit shows through. The wine is firmly dry, the texture linear, the fruit showing some black currant character."
"Slightly more concentrated than other Marlborough Pinots in this price range, the 2008 Mana displays modest cherry fruit and an array of savory elements, including game, brine and peppery spice. It's a bit rough around the edges, yet in a charming sort of way. Drink nowâ€“2012."
"Acidity marks this fresh, young Pinot Noir. It's as if the raspberry and cherry wine has been enlivened with a splash or three of lime juice. This primary fruit tartness may be because the wine was bottled and rushed to market too early. Don't drink it now. Give it a year or two to integrate."
"Clove and dark Indian spice is the protagonist here and background aromas of cherry and moist earth play supporting roles. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth with a bright, zesty close."
"Made from an unknown blend of grapes, this nonvintage red is good, dry and versatile. It has juicy flavors of blackberries and pepper, with some extra layers of depth that make it a good value for a restaurant by-the-glass wine."
"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura."
"This is a classic interpretation of Chianti Classico with bright aromas of small berry fruit, raspberry and blue flower. But there's also a modern touch as well that comes off aromatically as spice and new leather."
"This wine is missing great depth of flavor. It has bright acidity and hints of peach fruit flavors, but remains dull."
"There's pineapple and sharp dill on the nose of this wine from a Gilroy-based producer. Once sipped, apple cider and a tinge of petrol flavors emerge."
"This is a generous, rounded and very perfumed wine. Candy and bubble gum flavors give sweetness that contrasts with the acidity."
"Faithful to its label, this zero-degree residual-sugar Riesling is stark, steely and intensely dry. Bracing lemon acidity and tart green-apple flavors lend a tight, unyielding feel to the palate, but it's a refreshing accompaniment to creamy pasta or chicken dishes. Drink now."
"The wine is tight, green and herbal. It has some fruitiness, but that is suppressed by general underripeness. The tannins are hard at the end."
"Dusty mineral and earth tones lend a savory feel to delicate cherry and red-plum flavors in this pale pink rosÃ©. Bright, fresh raspberry-lemonade acidity bristles on the palate."
"Funky aromas of farmyard, tire rubber and fetid flowers waft from the glass of this Nero d'Avola. The muddled palate offers stewed prune, overripe black plum and oaky vanilla alongside bitter, green sensations of old sage. Panebianco, Vinity."
"Aromas of pressed apple and pear are savory and earthy on this brisk, medium-bodied GrÃ¼ner Veltliner. There's a dusty minerality that lingers through the midpalate, but the finish is bright and lemony."
"Pleasant and fruity to sip, soft in texture, light- to medium bodied, it has a rich yellow-gold color, butter-candy aromas, ripe apple flavors and a slightly sweet finish."
"This blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah is a chunky, slightly rustic style of CÃ´tes-du-RhÃ´ne. It starts off with tar and herb aromas, then turns plummy and chocolaty on the palate. Drink nowâ€“2017."
"Peach and apple aromas are fruity but not precise or minerally. This has peachy acidity but a wide, unfocused palate. Flavors of peach and nectarine are tasty but lack the crispness that AlbariÃ±o is known for."
"This tight wine has red fruit acidity without the richness. With its green edge, it's likely to remain full of acidity even as it matures."
"Made of Kinali Yapincak, a grape native to Turkey, this deep-straw colored wine does not give up much on the nose beyond a touch of apricot and just-washed cotton sheets. It does not seem wholly integrated on the palate, with chewy tannins overpowering flavors of melon, toast and white flower."
Pressed apple notes are touched with butter and creamed corn on this savory-style Chardonnay. It's rich and full on the palate with a satisfying silkiness that's brightened with lemony acidity.
"The green fruit flavors dominate this very fresh, crisp wine. It has acidity as much as fruitiness, giving a steely, tight character. Drink now."
Mild aromas of apple and generic white fruits are friendly enough. This has a monotone citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of tangerine and grapefruit. A bit of stalky corn and hay flavor rises up on the finish.
"A firm wine that is mainly tannin without a great fruit element. It is dry, tight and hard-edged."
"Tropical in character, this wine has soft acidity and an attractive texture. With ripe mango flavor, it's full in the mouth and ready to drink."
"Burnt caramel aromas give a wine that has weight, sweetness and packs in the vanilla. It misses out on real fruitiness, giving weight rather than freshness."
"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way."
"Lush and tropical with rich, ripe streaks of pineapple and mango, this medium-sweet Riesling is unabashedly forward and fruity, but hints of earth and dust on the midpalate lend a dark tone. Light on its feet, with a lemony finish."
"Tight, acidic and very crisp, it's propelled forward by lemon zest and grapefruit flavors. It is bright, fruity and light in texture."
"This soft, open wine has a light fruit character with attractive acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
"A vegetal wine that has acidity and rhubarb flavors. It is tight and full of acidity, with a very citrusy aftertaste. Drink now."
"While pulpy and ripe on the nose with aromas of blackberry and cherry compote, this Cabernet Franc runs towards the savory side on the palate. Bold in body and alcohol, it's rich with red fruit, but has a musty, earthen tone that persists through the finish."
"Dusty in tannins and planky in wood, this chewy red blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec into a mouthful of black olive, black currant and leather."
"Scents of fresh red cherries and bramble wood entice on the nose of this aromatic, spice-toned Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate, while crisp with cranberry acidity, is a bit subdued with subtle red-fruit flavor and a finish that wraps up short and tight."
"Raisiny, pruny aromas are all that register on this rubbery, jammy Garnacha. Flavors of sweet plum, raspberry and raisin are chunky, while the finish is raisiny in flavor and rubbery in feel."
"Gritty, intense, oaky and powerful from start to finish, this displays black-fruit aromas, hints of asphalt and an intense mouthfeel with a tight grip. A common duo of black-fruit and oaky flavors finishes with vanilla notes and a hint of coconut. Drink this structured, fully tannic RDD through 2028."
"Electric lemon-lime acidity reverberates throughout this light-bodied Riesling. The palate is fruity, pulsing with sweet, fresh peach, apricot and tangerine flavors. The finish lingers on a delicately lacy sweetness."
"This hails from a 1,000â€“1,400-foot elevation site above the valley floor called Oakville Ranch that contributes beautiful power in its firm, integrated tannin and oak. Balanced, the wine exudes lovely notes of boysenberry tart, blackberry and cedar, with a dusting of clove."
"This is a rich, peppery and generously tannic and full-bodied expression of the grape, both powerful and brimming in grace. Soft and mellow on the midpalate, it builds up ripeness and texture toward the finish, ending with a satisfying bite of graham cracker and chocolate."
"Lean, tight and austere, this textbook Eden Valley Riesling should develop well over the next 5â€“8 years, reaching maturity around 2022. Scents of petrichor and tangerine ease into tart lemon-lime notes on the palate, ending tart and mouthpuckering."
"This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality. It starts with aromas of charcoal and charred oak, goes to ripe, rich but not sweet fruit flavors, and finishes with all that grip as well as lingering smoky nuances."
"This wine has fine tannins, ripe berry fruits and well-integrated acidity. Rich and juicy, it offers blackberry flavors and a crisp aftertaste. Drink this wine, part of a range of wines from across Portugal, from 2018."
"Subtle, well-balanced and rich in texture, this full-bodied wine sneaks up on the taste buds, starting with mild Bosc pear and toasted-almond aromas, then pouring richer pear, honey and hazelnut flavors onto the palate. A slight reserve in the flavors is more than offset by a quiet complexity and lingering finish."
"Super-concentrated and intense, this starts with a very deep color and aromas like espresso and smoked meat. Flavors suggest black cherry and cranberry shaded with spices. An earthy, savory thread runs through all the dark fruit and spices, lingering on the finish."
"Planted in 1965, these are the oldest examples of this variety in the country. Jason Lett showcases this special fruit in this natural wine with no sulfites added and no cold stabilization. Light gold in color, the crisp apple flavors are forward, the balance is spot on and the finish polished. Drink now through 2020."
"In this inaugural release, winemaker James MacPhail travels to the far reaches of Annapolis to source grapes from the true wilderness, the site next door to Goldrock Ridge Vineyard. Made in a full-bodied style, this wine is intriguing in dried herb, black pepper and forest floor, with a healthy, lengthy seasoning of savory black tea."
"This bone-dry and floral wine will taste great with simple appetizers like toasted nuts or fresh cheeses. It is very well concentrated and has medium to full body. An opulent texture helps carry the floral, appley, grapefruity flavors into the finish."
"A slightly bitter tobacco note frames black-cherry fruit. The tannins need more time to smooth out, and that bitter streak is a bit worrisome. But that said, this powerful deep compact wine may explode with flavor if you have the patience to cellar it. Drink after 2020."
"This thoroughly delightful wine puts a polished sheen on this grape, that is so often lost in the shuffle between Pinot Gris and Chardonnay. Here the clean and fresh flavors of grapefruit, white peach and melon mingle gracefully, with palate-pleasing texture and zippy acidity."
"With a pronounced sensibility of caramelized apple and toasted brioche, this wine opens with a memorable lushness and richness that finds its balance in stony minerality. The highlights of flavor lean into golden pear compote and lemon zest, with a delicate seasoning of ginger."
"This is a beautifully perfumed wine, ripe with black fruits and generous with its tannins and acidity. It comes from a one-acre parcel called Le Vivier which has 70-year-old vines. It is concentrated, dense and with aging potential. Drink from 2018."
"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah vineyards, this wine wins over fans by its brains rather than its brawn. High-toned aromas of dried herbs mix with notes of raspberry, blue fruit and iron. The flavors are fresh and layered, bringing a sense of vibrancy and deliciousness."
"From century-old vines, this wine is potent and focused, with powerful, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels polished and precise. The aromas favor black cherry and black pepper, the flavors are fresh and mouth-filling, and the wine has firm acidity and tannins that make the texture appetizing."
"The winery's flagship wine, Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half, with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Despite its age, it starts tight as a drum, with light aromas of spice, dark cherry, coffee and dried flowers. It's full flavored, with a dazzling richness to the textured fruit and barrel notes. Best after 2021."
"A blend from two vineyards, this wine is rich and full bodied, with fine tannins and a dark concentration. With its perfumed character and tight structure, it is impressive, full of black fruits with a strong mineral streak. Drink this still-young wine from 2019."
"Though labeled as a Syrah, this drinks more like a GSM, with 11% MourvÃ¨dre, 5% Grenache and 2% Viognier contributing prominently to the blend. Aromas of cocoa, orange peel, coffee grounds, raspberry and dark fruit are followed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors."
"A pretty light gold hue, this wine shines brightly from the first sniff to the last sip. It's clean and dense, with notes of bee pollen and lemon oil, flavors of apple and pear, and a touch of vanilla cookie."
"Dusty minerals, pollen and spice notes lend complexity to this honey-toned auslese. The palate is decadently sweet, glazed in caramelized sugar and heaving with ripe cantaloupe and peach flavors. A bite of lemon-lime acidity offsets all the opulence, lending edge to a long, lingering finish."
"Layers of exotic spice and crushed earth permeate through this dry Riesling paying just homage to it's red-clay origins in Ãœrziger WÃ¼rzgarten, the spice garden of the Mosel. It's exquisitely light bodied, a revitalizing crush of cutting white grapefruit and lime flavors. The finish is marked by a meandering spray of spice and honey. Drinks well now but should improve through at least 2030."
"Big and bold in character, this full-bodied and abundantly tannic wine looks black to the rim and smells like pencil shavings, leather and wood smoke. The flavors are dry but enticing, with dark chocolate, charred beef and black cherry. It needs until at least 2022 to peak."
"From a different block of the same vineyard as the â€œWhale labelâ€ Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment. It's smooth and suppleâ€”a pretty wine with honeyed minerality around fruit flavors of citrus and peaches."
"This five-grape blend is muscular and wide on the palate, with oaky berry flavors that are also tarry and toasty. Hard tannins and some chop on the finish suggest further aging would be beneficial. Drink this Cabernet-led blend that also includes Garnacha, Syrah, Merlot and Cab Franc through 2025."
"The aromas jump up, with mesmerizing notes of fresh herbs, green olive, violets, orange peel, smoked meat and huckleberry. The palate shows a light but pillowy texture alongside flavors that carry on the finish. It's all about subtlety."
"Produced in the Douro Superior region in the far east of the Douro Valley, this wine is dense with tarry tannins and black fruits. Wood aging and the concentration of old vines make it impressive. Drink now until 2022."
"The Reserve version of this brand, this young wine is ripe and firm, with great potential. The Duas Quintas (two estates) are Ervamoira and Bons Ares, both in the Douro Superior. With attractive smoky flavors and ripe red-berry fruits it will become a rich wine. Drink from 2020."
"Lemon pith and ripe peach aromas are clouded under a distinctly medicinal tone of baby aspirin. While there is nice roundness to the palate and balanced acidity to boot, the flavors are mild showings of orchard fruit and lemon curd."
"Lightly floral aromas are dilute while hinting at quince jelly. There's not a lot of vitality to the palate, while tangerine and nectarine flavors are watery. Pithy citrus notes carry the finish before it putters out."
"Tropical aromas revolve around lemon-lime. This is acidic without much body. Flavors of lemon, melon, mango and green apple are lean and finish with tangy, pithy citrus flavors."
"Bland aromas suggest applesauce. This varietal Xarello feels plump but flat. Candied, generic white-fruit flavors are nonspecific, while this offers up citrus notes and pyrazines on the finish."
"From the producer's Old Vineyard Block, and blended with 20% Petite Sirah and 5% Syrah, this wine has a rustic barnyardy quality. It offers a tightness of dried herb around broad, sweet tannins, strawberry jam and chocolate."
"Meant to provide value, this wine also offers big oak, smoke and a bittersweet taste of black-tea tannins. Shy in fruit, this has a slightly reduced effect on the finish."
"Apple skin and guava rise out from a more buttery aroma that leads to oak on the palate. Light bodied, the wine finishes tart in lemon and lime."
"Leafy, green aromas suggest eucalyptus and a briar patch. A lean palate offers aroma-matching flavors of green herbs along with plum, cherry and clay notes. This is oaky and resiny tasting on the finish, and hot as well."
"This is on the light side, with simple flavors and a juicy, soft texture that shows very little tannin. Aromas and flavors recall cherries and strawberries."
"Pruney and somewhat reduced, this thick offering of chocolate and blackberry jam needs food to mellow it out, preferably meat covered thickly in sauce."
"Wiry, briary currant and herbal aromas announce a hard but juicy wine with buttery oak, salty red fruit flavors and a loud herbal angle. This is both briny tasting and a touch weedy on the finish."
"This is a rich, full wine that has red fruits and soft tannins. With balanced acidity, only a hint of tannins, it is ready to drink."
"This is a gentle, ripe wine that has pineapple and peach flavors and fresh fruitiness. It is smooth with balanced acidity and a zesty aftertaste. Drink now."
"A young, fresh blend of Arinto and FernÃ£o Pires, the wine is fruity, light and with a crisp, bright aftertaste. Drink now."
"Somewhat disjointed flavors mix subtle red fruits with cracker, licorice and coffee. So far the components have not smoothed out. It's a flavor jumble."
Faint notes of yuzu rise over underripe peach in this unoaked Chardonnay. The light-bodied palate shows a mild concentration of lemon leading to a short but clean finish.
"Muddled aromas of tangerine, grapefruit and papaya seem a bit soapy in character. The palate feels a bit underripe, showing milky florals upfront and unconcentrated citrus on the back."
"The wine is fresh with red berry flavors and a stalky tannic core. It's lightly perfumed, light in texture and ready to drink."
"There is an attractive, light prickle on the tongue of this fresh, crisp and fruity wine. It is dry, tensely tangy with a green, zesty character. Drink now."
Oily aromas of orange peel are inoffensive. A shearing palate offers little textural pleasure or complexity. Flavors of lemon and blood orange finish with a sour note of underripe pineapple.
"This somewhat indistinctive wine has a wealth of minty aroma on the nose, a characteristic that doesn't shake off on the palate, the body full and a touch hot."
"Yeasty aromas are devoid of fruit, commitment and minerality, and instead smell oddly floral and unconvincing. A waxy, wan palate and oaky flavors of clove finish with resiny, pushy spice notes. This tastes overly oaky and resiny, like the winery's Rioja white called La CapellanÃ­a but without the goods."
"The wine is fruity, although with a yeasty character that leaves a bready taste. It has acidity, ripe yellow fruits and the fruitiness may come to dominate although that is not certain."
"There's something mushroomy and feral about this wine, which finishes with sour cherry."
"A blend of Moscatel and Arinto, this is light and thin with only the vaguest hint of citrus fruit acidity. It should be drunk now."
"The nose isn't very expressive but you can detect whiffs of adhesive bandage, medicinal herb, apple skin and mineral that carry over to the diluted, rather bitter palate. Brisk acidity underscores the wine's lean character."
"While very flavorful, this wine is more of a dessert drink than a lunch or dinner wine. It smells sweet and earthy, feels unctous and tastes sweet, especially on the finish."
"Candied raspberry aromas and a racy, acidic, crisp feel tell you what's coming: pie-cherry tartness and then a sizzle-and-pop finish that's fresh but astringent."
"Balsamic aromas and strong pruney flavors combine for a heavy-handed taste in this full-bodied wine. It seems to be well-aged already, so drink it soon if you like this style."
"Earthy and stemmy in dark black fruit, this wine contains 2% Syrah from Dunnigan Hills, though it's unclear how that contributes. Thin on the palate, it has a medicinal, minty flourish on the finish."
"Aromas of blueberries, beef roast and fudge give way to a light, straightforward palate of purple fruit. It's a clean wine, but not very complex."
Rustic aromas are followed by rough-edged fruitiness in this young wine. It has ripe berry fruits as well as some firm tannins in the background. It is not yet integrated and needs to develop much more. Drink from 2018.
"This light, bright wine comes from the north of the Vinho Verde region. It has freshly squeezed lemon juice with a touch of lime zest as well as spice. The lightest prickle on the tongue gives the wine a final lift."
"Chunky, slightly jammy plum and blackberry aromas are good but basic. In the mouth, this shows tartaric grit and bite along with lean fruit. Flavors of red plum and raspberry finish zesty but with hardly any complexity."
"This wine also contains 25% Zinfandel and is wildly savage in herb, baked plum jam, tobacco and a strong arm of oak. Midpalate, it takes on more savory peppercorn and herb over fruit, finishing mildly."
"There's a slightly reductive quality on the nose of this wine, with rubber, tar, dill and hot lava rock notes. The palate shows roast beef char, sour cherry fruits and asphalt."
"A blend of two different vineyards, this ripe wine is now very mature. It has lost its primary fruitiness and developed toasty spice as well as a more funky, earthy character."
"In this blend of Shiraz and Trincadeira, both grapes contribute red fruits, soft tannins and fresh-faced acidity. With no complicationsâ€”just bright, juicy fruitâ€”the wine is ready to drink."
"Both mineral and herbaceous, this is a crisp, taut and textured wine. It shows a tangy character, lemon zest and bright acidity. It's still too young, so drink from the end of 2015."
"Similar to the winery's regular Pinot Noir, this is moving quickly along the aging curve. Hints of strawberry fruit are cloaked in barrel flavors of mocha and cracker. Drink soon."
"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice. From the cooler Coombsville appellation, it is soft, round and on the paler, thinner side of Napa's ripeness spectrum, more restrained."
"The inaugural vintage of this wine, named for a water goddess, this offers herb, grass, lemon and peach around a medium body influenced by some oak. As it develops in the glass, tropical fruit unfurls in a refreshing spritz before settling down to a tart finish."
"The wine is still young with its crisp red fruits and tense tannins. It is a structured wine, firm with a dry core and still developing its fruitiness. It will need to age a while yet, so drink from 2018."
"The aromas are light, with notes of freshly cut apple and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a very pretty styling."
"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor."
"Jammy plum and berry aromas come with dessert herb scents. A juicy palate doesn't offer much structure, but this Monastrell-Syrah blend tastes good courtesy of plum, blackberry and toasty flavors. The ripe warm finish is generous."
"Smooth and polished, this medium-bodied wine has attractive fruit and cinnamon aromas, generous dark-fruit flavors, and light touches of baking spices."
Aromas of vanilla and cocoa mix with red fruit. The fruit flavors are full and palate coating but the oak seems a little too intense at times.
"Hibiscus and strawberry scents make an appealing invitation on the nose of this bottling, and then light cola and pepper spice up the ante. This would be a great red for warmer weather, served with a slight chill that would still allow the flavors of sandalwood, red cherry and marjoram to emerge."
"Though a reserve bottling, this shows a very fresh and sprightly side of the grape rather than its dense face. Squeezed blackberries, just-picked thyme and a touch of burnt caramel show on the nose, while the palate offers Concord grape, boysenberry and iced-coffee flavors."
"Melon, nectarine and mild citrus aromas are clean and direct. This basic white is firm and balanced, while stone fruit, melon and white-pepper flavors end easy and fresh."
"This structured wine has a strong mineral element. With black-currant and berry flavors, it is firm and still young. Swathes of rich fruit are sustained by solid tannins. Drink from late 2017."
"Candied black cherry and fresh boysenberry aromas meet with darker touches of soy, teriyaki and burnt caramel on the nose of this bottling. The palate is mineral-driven, with light tar, asphalt and peppercorn flavors leading into dusty elderberry fruit."
"The second wine of Vale MeÃ£o, this is rich and fruity. It has enough structure to allow it to develop while also having plenty of red-berry fruits and soft tannins. Give this wine until 2019."
Red-berry fruits and soft tannins give a wine with some juicy acidity and spice. The firm aftertaste shows that it is still needs time. Drink from 2018.
Spice from wood aging is the initial character of this wine. Then the fruit comes through more strongly to give the wine richness and structure. Drink from 2018.
"Aromatics of rose and mint give this wine prettiness on the nose before getting into darker, richer components on the palate. Medium in build, it retains a sizable tannin presence in its youth, complemented by dark cherry and a char on the oak."
"A mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a bit rough and tumble, as the name might suggest. Hard cherry candy carries a touch of rubber, and some rugged tannins. That said, it's got plenty of punch and power."
"Earthy nose of dried underbrush, truffle and scorched soil give way to cranberry and sour cherry flavors. Dried herb and dark spice add some depth while tightly packed astringent tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish. It's rather straightforward but let the tannins relax for another few years then drink."
"A blend of 85% Nebbiolo and 15% Uva Rara, this fragrant red boasts alluring scents of pressed rose, moist earth, aromatic herb and whiff of exotic spice. The racy straightforward palate doles out tart red cherry, star anise and a hint of clove alongside fine-grained tannins and firm acidity."
"This is a very good, medium-bodied wine. It has lightly oaky aromas, lots of fruit flavor, a smooth texture and an almost-sweet finish."
"This is a light-bodied and full-flavored wine with a good, gripping texture and plenty of ripe plum and black pepper aromas. A fruity and beefy flavor carries through the finish."
"An innovative blend of Sauvignon Blanc (53%), Semillon (37%) and Viognier (10%), this medium-bodied wine delivers a mix of figs and melons, underscored by a silky texture. Ready to drink."
"Cola, plum and red-currant aromas set up a tight palate with clamping tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis, plum and chocolate are lasting across the finish. This needs hearty food, additional airing or both to show its best."
"Heady aromas like wood smoke, black pepper and new rubber tire lead to equally peppery, smoky flavors and a firm, nicely tannic texture. The wine is medium to full bodied and well concentrated."
"This hand-picked, wild-fermented Chardonnay offers a lot to like. Notes of toasted grain, ripe pear and melon create a balanced blend of citrusy fruit and oaky spice, while the refreshing pineapple and clove notes linger on the finish."
"From a relatively cool site for the variety, this white shows an abundance of green olive and Meyer lemon. Moderate body and acidity allow for a touch of lemongrass spiciness and black licorice amid the textured mouthfeel and length."
"Aromas of prune, blackberry, lemon peel and shoe polish are dark and earthy. This feels full and chewy, with hard tannins. Dark toasty black-fruit flavors come with herbal notes and wood spice flavors, while this tastes herbal, oaky, minty and like clove on the finish."
"Odd aromas of curried meat and iodine are more unusual than off-putting. This feels a bit wide and heavy, with flatness to the palate. Flavors of roasted plum and savory spices suggest lamb curry, while this feels robust and aggressive on a slightly hot finish."
"This very focused wine is deeply colored, has smoky, meaty aromas and concentrated fruit flavors. It is full bodied, firm and moderately tannic in texture."
"Pretty aromas of cherry and plum blossoms give way to fully ripe, slightly confectionary fruit, backed by hints of mocha. This medium-bodied Pinot Noir is supple in texture and softly dusty on the finish, making it an easy one to drink over the next couple of years."
"Nuances of vanilla and toasted baguette add flair to this full-bodied and textural wine. It has straightforward crisp apple and grapefruit flavors, a dry balance, and a taut, almost astringent finish."
This California-made Oregon Pinot captures a sense of the particular terroir of Chehalem Mountains fruit. Wild strawberries are laced with peppery spice and a streak of cola. Good penetration and texture.
"Full-bodied aromas of vanilla, ripe blackberry, spice and cinnamon lead this assertive red from Drama. Rich, spicy and savory on the palate, the wine has a nice balance of minerality and layered fruit. The finish has a smoky spin."
Here's a blend of Merlot and Franconia (aged 48 months in oak) with straightforward aromas of cherry fruit and underbrush. The wine is smooth and offers slight sweetness followed by some sour notes on the close.
"It's said that Viognier is difficult to grow, but then how can bargains such as this continue to exist? For $10, you get truffled pear aromas rounded out by the addition of melon, decent concentration and a long, dusty-minerally finish. Drink now."
"Beautifully pale pink in color with delicate shadings of peach and copper, this is an extremely elegant rosÃ© sparkler from the Franciacorta area of northern Italy. The aromas are simple and straightforward, focusing on rose petal, cranberry and peach. The mouthfeel is crisp and easy."
"Here's a really good value in a dry, full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon. It's filled with varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a long, sweet finish. The tannins are sturdy and ripe. Fully ready now."
"A broad, welcoming wine, the second label from Malhadinha Nova. It has spiced acidity, flavors of plums, licorice, with cranberry juice tannins. The flavors are big and bold, nothing held back."
"A robust, softly tannic and powerfully ripe wine showing flavors of cherry pie filling, cola, raisins, red licorice and dusty Asian spices. This dry Bordeaux-style blend contains some Petite Sirah, and is at its best nowâ€“2012."
"Rather tough and gritty now, this bone dry wine offers herb, tobacco and cedar flavors, with suggestions of cherries and currants. It's the answer to folks who complain that California Cabernets are fruit and oak bombs. Could surprise with 5â€“7 years in the bottle."
"Cheerful and bright, this well-priced wine offers a great introduction to Barbaresco to those who might be less familiar with this noble Italian wine. Vibrant aromas include wild berries, cola and a touch of smoked ham. The mouthfeel is crisp and very clean despite the hot vintage."
"Dry, minty and saucy on the nose, with an old-school sheer palate full of acidity, citrus, cherry tomato, herbs and snap. Shows toasty oak, length and cheeky tannins along with red fruit finishing notes. In between new wave and traditional Rioja. Drink now through 2012."
"This barrel-fermented blend of Grenache Blanc, Vermentino and Roussanne features hints of toasted hazelnuts, but also plenty of ripe pear flavors and touches of spice and acacia blossom. The texture is lush, the flavors bold, just fading a bit in intensity on the finish."
"A fresh, juicy wine with berry fruits, ripe but intense tannins and a black cherry flavor. There is a delicious, final burst of acidity."
"Rich, lush and oaky with aromas and flavors of ripe red plum, red berries and vanilla cream. Round and full in the mouth with solid but soft tannins and moderate acidity. The finish is long and lingering, with suggestions of vanilla ice cream topped with mixed berry compote. Drink now."
"Though the winery indicates that just one quarter of the barrels (all French oak) were new, this wine puts those spicy, toasty scents and flavors of mocha and cinnamon front and center. It's soft and silky, with round, forward flavors of plums dipped in chocolate."
"A dry, spicy wine, with some good dense tannins. There is some power here, the dark fruits hinting at sweetness, but this is followed by the high acidity typical of the vintage. It should all come together in a year to 18 months."
"There is plenty of wood, both in aromas and to taste. What is worrying is the dominance of the wood over the relatively light fruit character. There are just hints of Cabernet black currants, but then the wood closes in. It needs 3â€“4 years to come together."
"Good density here, with tannins that spring from bright berry fruits. The acidity is certainly present, but it has weight behind it, giving potential richness balanced by wood."
"A finely made wine, with elegant fruit and tannins, but definitely on the light side. The red berry fruits are soft and juicy, already a pleasure to drink, with only short-term aging."
"Relatively lightweight, the wine has soft, stalky tannins and flavors of hedgerow fruits to go with the well-judged layer of smoky wood. It is dry, firm and fresh."
"A firm, solidly tannic wine that is balanced easily between tight fruit tannins, elegant plum fruits and taut acidity. The aftertaste is smoky from the wood, but with the fruit always present."
"With light spiciness, this is a full-bodied wine, dominated by tropical fruits. It is rich, rounded, soft, with touches of honey."
"Attractive, soft, white-fruit wine, its pear flavors rounded and gentle. This is a perfect apÃ©ritif style, easy with light acidity to cut through the ripe fruit."
"Subtle and crisp in profile, this not-quite-dry Riesling from Lakewood Vineyards is delicate in its soft, slightly underripe peach and apricot tones. Vibrant acidity and a clean, floral spray on the finish make it wonderfully refreshing."
"A fragrant start brings raspberries and rose petals, along with traces of Dr. Pepper and cinnamon spice. In the mouth the wine fades a bit, not showing the depth that the aromas seem to promise. Good flavors, just a little light."
"Rounded, spicy wine with only light acidity and more of the lychee and mango side. It is ripe and generous, hinting at a dry core of firmness."
"Winemaker Morten Hallgren harnesses a traditional Italian grape-drying technique called appassimento to create this richly concentrated but dry Chardonnay. Initial notes of smoke and roasted hazelnut skins fade on the nose and palate to reveal a clean, fresh apple and pear character, speckled with white flowers and a bright lemon-lime acidity."
"Barbecue, black olives, Indian spice and mature fruit open the nose of this rich Ripasso made with a traditional blend of Valpolicella red grapes. There's a touch of green curry and forest floor, but the wine ultimately closes on a plush sweet note."
"A tannic Sierra Foothills Sangiovese that's plenty earthy, exhibiting swathes of licorice and berry too."
"This Ripasso opens with a solid, direct approach spearheaded by plump aromas of cherry, chocolate and a touch of root beer. In the mouth, it shows medium structure with a clean, polished close."
"Chard fans will exult in this spicy wine. It packs a potent punch of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and honey, and is nicely balanced with crisp acidity."
"The spectrum of varietal aromas is here: saline, olive, forest floor, tea and red and black fruits. Weighty and round in the mouth, with good feel and full blackberry flavors supported by creamy oak and vanilla. Juicy and red enough on the finish, where a pop of acidity registers."
"Topaz Imperial is Sparkling Pointe's first nonvintage blend of the three traditional Champagne grape varieties. While intensely aromatic of ripe red berries and plums, it maintains an elegant dryness throughout. Rich on the palate with a soft, delicate mousse, it lingers long on an earthy, mushroom-scented finish."
"There's an earthy note here that recalls button mushroom and horse skin backed by dried fruit and prune. The wine shows a lighter, crisper mouthfeel with a sweet versus sour contrast at the very end."
"Loosen's Grosses GewÃ¤chs bottling from old vines is plump, custardy and slightly sweet-tasting, buoyed by ample ripe apple and peach flavors and tinged with hints of lime, fern fronds and crushed stone. It might well have been more impressive served in a different (sweeter) flight; in this context it seemed slightly soft."
"Vacillates between seeming totally fresh and clean and showing herbal, light green notes. There's graham cracker, jammy blackberry and bergamot on the nose, but also a pickled element. Grabby, chunky and jammy in the mouth, with juicy acidity and blue fruit flavors."
"A wine that is so perfumed, consummate pleasure to drink. It is soft as well as rich, the spice packed into a rounded structure. Drink now."
"There's a touch of pungent apple skin at first, but the bouquet opens up over time with pretty floral tones and shadings of forest fruit and dried raspberry. For an Amarone, this wine is surprisingly bright and crisp on the close."
"While the nose on this unoaked Chardonnay is exuberant with billowing, ripe yellow stonefruit and floral aromas, the palate is quite brisk in style with a lean, steely acidity. Dry and medium bodied, it's an exceptionally elegant Chardonnay."
"This frankly sweet sparkler smells like toasted almonds and pistachios, and tastes rich, round, floral and nutty. It has a good, fine bead, nice balance from the wine's acidity, and feels smooth and broad in texture."
"A soft and fruity style of rosÃ© from a small Aube producer, this is ripe with red berry fruit and bright with acidity and orange zest tang. Dominated by Chardonnay, its color coming from still Pinot Noir wine, it's ready to drink now."
"Dark berry, herb and blue-fruit aromas lead to silky fruit flavors. The tannins bring a slightly sticky feel to the finish."
"Beautifully smooth, this medium-bodied and easy-drinking wine seems to melt in the mouth. Black cherry, blueberry and light smoky aromas segue to more cherry and chocolate flavors on the palate, where the texture is soft and appealing. It's a harmonious blend of Zinfandel, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah."
"Candied black cherry, crushed thyme, marjoram, peppercorn and smoked meat show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is very sweet, nearly treacly by sip two, showing concentrated strawberry juice and hoisin spice against a thick mouthfeel."
"This is the inaugural release from this winery, which dedicates itself to the production of Grenache. A blend of fruit from Alder Ridge and Upland vineyards, it brings aromas of red plum, herb and spice that are followed by elegant, mouthwatering red-fruit flavors. It shows the variety's more delicate side."
"This is a blend of 46% dry-farmed Merlot, 45% Malbec and 9% Petit Verdot from the Lamonica Vineyard south of the Stags Leap District. Cola, leather and coffee ride a smoothly tannic, medium-bodied offering of likable approachability."
"Soft, layered and reasonably complex, this red blend showcases juicy black cherry, cassis and a wealth of dried herb. A good value for the quality, it'll serve a gathering well, or do its job as a weekday wine."
"One of Oregon's best-kept secrets is this well-made budget-priced Pinot from Eola Hills. Aged in French and American oak for just under one year, it's labeled as a plain Oregon AVA, but it's 95% Willamette Valley fruit. That brings an extra dimension to the wine, with some tannic muscle and a streak of dried leaf and forest floor flavors along with ripe strawberry fruit."
"Acacia, honeyed nut and yellow stone fruit aromas lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate shows surprising depth for the cool wet vintage, offering yellow apple, pear and bitter almond alongside zesty acidity. A mouthwatering saline note wraps up the finish."
"Made entirely with Magliocco, a native grape from Calabria, this has aromas of black currant and Mediterranean herb. The straightforward palate delivers prune, cinnamon and tobacco alongside dusty tannins. Enjoy through 2019."
"Strong scents of cola and chocolate come up quickly from the glass, and those flavors notes override the light strawberry and cherry fruit. With a bit of breathing time they all combine gracefully, crafting a full forward wine with a pleasing creamy texture."
"This opens with enticing scents of white spring flower and white orchard fruit. On the bright palate, a hint of bitter almond underscores green apple and nectarine while bright acidity and a saline note provide a mouthwatering finish."
"This is high-octane and boldly ripe wine from the wilds of Calistoga, offering bacon char, cranberry, plum and a richness of milk chocolate."
"Soft, supple and floral, this wine is full-bodied and moderately structured, offering bold swathes of compost, sage and cola spice."
"Bright aromas of raspberry, herb, cigar box and dried cranberry are followed by full-bodied cranberry and raspberry flavors. It delivers enjoyment but seems a bit dried out."
"This is the producer's nonvintage cuvÃ©eâ€”a crisp, apple-flavored wine dominated by the softness of Pinot Meunier. It's fruity with an attractive and zesty acidity. A great apÃ©ritif-style Champagne."
"Herbal in a shock of dusty sage and black tea, this is a layered, robust wine, deep in raspberry and vanilla flavor with a mineral-laden belly of stone. The finish is tannic and lengthy, showy in oak."
"Aromas of orange pulp and peel are hanging in there. This feels both oily and citric, while sour-leaning citrus flavors are a bit salty. On the finish, this feels plump and holds onto its citrusy essence. Drink immediately."
"From its cellar in AÃ¿, this small nÃ©gociant buys grapes from a range of villages. This signature wine is soft with a crisp background and delicate acidity. Rounded and full of white fruit on the finish, it's ready to drink."
"A field mix of seven varieties, this is a sanguine, thick and rich wine, softly layered in licorice, fig and cranberry, with a big presence on the palate. Dusty and leathery, it begs emphatically to be paired with pizza."
"The nose on this bottling is quite complex and elegant, with black cherry syrup, cola, milk chocolate and sandalwood touches. The palate is more straightforward, with blackberry-balsamic sauce and black cherry fruit."
"This GSM pink wine offers very inviting notes of fresh watermelon, strawberry, pink rose and slight bubblegum on the nose. With ripe strawberry flavors and a slight orange bitterness toward the finish, this is a perfect wine for sunny afternoons and beach days, if the slightest bit sweet."
"This opens with aromas of tilled soil, underbrush and prune. The dense palate delivers blackberry jam, vanilla and toasted oak alongside chewy tannins that leave a rather astringent finish."
"This is a tightly wrought wine, the white fruit flavors given a nervy edge of minerality. Its fruit and acidity are coming into balance, needing further age to fully integrate. Drink from 2018."
"This nonvintage cuvÃ©e is dominated by Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. That gives richness as well as a crisp lemon and tangy orange character. Ripe and full, it's balanced and ready to drink."
"Round and accessible, this smooth straightforward Aglianico offers flavors of juicy blackberry, wild cherry, ripe plum and baking spice framed in supple tannins. There's not much complexity, but it is delicious. Drink through 2019."
"Typical varietal aromas of wild berry and damp earth lift from the glass while the rather lean vibrant palate offers morello cherry, blackberry and star anise. Racy acidity and firm tightly packed tannins provide the backbone. Drink 2019â€“2026."
"A good sense of concentration and depth make this medium-bodied wine taste big and satisfying without overdoing it. It has a very dark color, fruity and lightly spicy aromas, rich plum and black cherry flavors and rather mild tannins."
"A nuanced touch of residual sugar softens the edges of this zesty, light-footed Riesling. Its sweet-tart lemon and lime flavors are thirst-quenching and crisp. Touches of crushed minerals and nuts mark its brisk finish."
"A fragrant Barolo, showing intense rose and violet aromas with undertones of red fruits and spice. The palate delivers dense dark cherry, white pepper and mint flavors, with a hint of vanilla. It's long and linear but still young, with aggressive tannins that need time to mellow."
"This is a delicate sweet Riesling, honeyed and with intense acidity as a foil. The wine is delicate, holding back on its richness with a light touch, and very poised. The wine is destined for aging over at least six years and more. Screwcap."
"Vasse Felix's impressively consistent track record with Cabernet continues with the 2009, a mouth-filling, supple wine that still retains a modicum of structure. Bold cassis fruit is balanced by earthy, meaty complexity and finishes long and mouthwatering. Drinkable now, but it should hold easily through 2020, and possibly longer."
"A terrific wine, with a crisp, clean, classic nose of pure, crystalline Sauvignon Blanc. Done in all stainless, sourced from Artz (Red Mountain) and Stillwater Creek (Ancient Lakes), this riot of melon, citrus, apple and sweet hay is just about perfect, with lovely natural acidity."
"D'Arenberg's The Coppermine Road is always structuredâ€”sometimes to excessâ€”but the 2009 vintage seems to have the requisite flesh to age successfully. Cedar, chocolate and cassis notes surround a firm core of dusty tannins. Drink from 2015â€“2025, and possibly beyond."
"Freeman's Ryo-fu Chardonnay always is a tasty, delicious wine. This wine shows a purity of tropical and citrus fruits, with subtle mineral, roasted nut and dried apple complexities, brightened by crisp, lemony acidity. Drink nowâ€“2017, but not too cold."
"Rubin is the name used in Carnuntum for those wines that have been judged by other producers in the region. Walter Glatzer's Rubin is solid, dark, concentrated and rich. It has the smoothness of wood aging while retaining its Bing-cherry and black-currant flavors. With its firm character, it needs some aging for four years and more."
"Firm and bold, this is a solid wine. Its tannins and ripe berry fruit are upfront, the acidity and fresh character of the vintage in the background. Powered by a dry core, this is a wine that could do with at least five years' aging."
"Yellow fruits lead off this sophisticated wine. With its creamy texture, overlaid by a more steely texture, it's a wine that has aging potential as well as present fruitiness for early drinking. So age for four years or give in to the freshness now. Screwcap."
"This traditionally crafted Barolo shows earthy sensations of truffle, underbrush and leather along with delicious spice and ripe cherry flavors, along with uplifting mineral notes. The ripeness demonstrates the warmth of the vintage."
"Giuseppe Nada and his son Enrico have produced an earthy and gripping Barbaresco, with floral, truffle aromas punctuated with Alpine herbs. The palate shows layers of dark cherry-berry fruit, balsamic notes of sage and mint, all backed up by a firmly tannic backbone. Best after 2016."
"From the Basarin vineyard area in the village of Neive, this shows power and finesse in its typical Nebbiolo sensations of underbrush, floral notes and truffle. The palate has creamy dark-cherry fruit layered with spices and balsamic herbs and a long finish. It will develop fully over the next few years and should age well."
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from one of Washington's most iconic vineyards, is aromatically appealing with barrel notes of toast, chocolate, and spice alongside earth and dark cherry. It's wound up at present with tart acids and tightly coiled tannins, showing impeccable restraint and elegance."
"L'Ecole's Columbia Valley Cabernet is again 100% varietal; the blending magic comes from a mix of excellent vineyards. This is a classy, classic wine, with pinpoint structure and spot-on varietal character. The compact palate is packed with details, and though it's drinking well, it is clearly a wine to cellar for a while longer. Notes of clean earth, clover, herb and light chocolate add depth to a core of black cherry and cassis."
"From a vineyard at the peak of the Sarmassa hill, this shows ripe berry and balsamic aromas and a hint of orange peel. The palate delivers juicy cherry flavors, mint and licorice notes, and has a firm tannic backbone. It also shows the warmth of the vintage, so it's best to drink in 5â€“10 years."
"Bella's only 2010 Zinfandel from the Russian River Valley is high in alcohol, but manages somehow to maintain balance. It's softly tannic and incredibly rich in chocolate, mulberry jam, cassis liqueur, prune and peppery-spice flavors. Delicious, but heady."
"Another dry, ageable Pinot from this fine winery. The light, silky texture and brisk acidity make it feel especially stimulating and easy. There's tremendous weight to the red fruits and currants. Give it 6â€“8 years in a good cellar."
"An austere Riesling in the traditional Australian style, the 2012 Isolation Ridge Riesling appears destined to have a long life. Penetrating lime aromas lead into a palate that's high strung and tight, but lined with mouthwatering fruit. An electric vibrancy of citrus and wet stones lingers on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2030."
"From Serralunga, this has a classic fragrance of wild cherry, rose petal, truffle, leather and hints of menthol. The palate delivers a juicy core of black cherry, mint and spice. It has a warm midpalate and big but ripe tannins, but it's a bit shy on acidityâ€”typical for the vintage."
"With only 12.5% alcohol by volume, this young-vine Chardonnay is one of the lightest, most delicate Chardonnays the winery has ever produced. But it's not shy on flavor, delivering waves of tropical fruits, peaches, vanilla and buttered toast. Long and sweet in honey, it finishes dry and racy. Defines the new elegant style of Chardonnay."
"Now approaching maturity, the wine is showing its tropical fruit flavors and aromas. Ripe and full in the mouth with a rich, but lively acidity, it's an impressive expression of Sauvignon Blanc. Glass stopper."
"By far the best Dewpoint to date, this tastes bone dry, yet it's succulent, concentrated, and lightly honeyed. The deep flavors of ripe Meyer lemon and citrus just keep on going and going."
"There's an intense punch of sweet yellow peach on this lip-smackingly delicious SpÃ¤tlese. Hints of savory spice and struck flint, and a deep, rippling minerality adds complexity and depth through the finish."
"A lovely Pinot Noir that shows fine Russian River character. Made from some good vineyards, including Keefer Ranch, it shows an elegant deliciousness of cherry and raspberry jam, cola and pomegranate flavors, touched with new oak. Silky and dry, this polished wine is good to drink now, and will hold for 6â€“8 years."
"This luxury cuvÃ©e from Thorne Clarke combines ripe berries with cinnamon and clove, then adds dollops of vanilla and chocolate, yet never seems overly sweet. Likewise, it's full bodied and rich, yet never goes over the top, maintaining a sense of freshness and structure. Drink nowâ€“2020, and possibly beyond."
"This wine is one of a series of single vineyard wines from this Cistercian estate. The wine exhibits the pepper side of GrÃ¼ner, full and flavorsome, along with spiced pear laced with citrus acidity. The wine is rich aging potential over the next 3â€“5 years."
"This single vineyard Malbec belongs with Washington's best. The mix of purple fruits and intense barrel flavors of clove, cocoa and dusty mocha inspires an impromptu â€œwowâ€ once in the mouth. Smooth, satiny and seamless, it has a gentle hint of earth and herb threaded through the finish."
"Aging for 18 months in oak has given this rich wine a smooth character, balancing juicy red berry flavors with complex barnyard and wild undergrowth flavors. The powerful combination demands aging even after four years, so give it another 3â€“4."
"L'Ecole's Walla Walla Cabernet has a soft-focus silkiness, an almost gauzy character. Behind that film is a wine tasting of wild berries, Bing cherries and fresh herbs, with light streaks of coffee and moist earth. Give this one plenty of decanting and the scrim lifts away and reveals a firm, beautifully balanced and nuanced wine."
"The Medieval Sancerre castle (Joan of Arc slept here) was built on the site of an ancient Roman fortress. Now owned by the producers of Grand Marnier liqueur, the vineyard produces an attractive, open style of wine. It has just the right tangy acidity along with delicious ripe apple and citrus fruits. The wine is ready to drink."
"This straw-colored wine made predominantely from Furmint has tropical aromas of passion fruit and mango and a touch of fresh white peach. White peach, yellow peach and guava flavors show on the palate before the zesty finish."
"Gamay is still fairly rare in Oregon but ripens well into a style more reminiscent of Zinfandel or Grenache than of Beaujolais. Robust and fruity, this has tart and spicy cranberry and cherry notes, with a nice acid/tannin balance that keeps the flavors moving along nicely through the finish."
"Very focused and deep aromas of boysenberry, violet, rose petal and anise make for a heady rich entry into this Grenache. There's a touch of caramel to the sip, where black cherry, clove, dried ginger and leather also show. It's a good example of how Grenache can ride the heavier side of the scale with style."
"Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this opens with black-skinned berry, sun-baked earth and Mediterranean brush aromas. It's polished and savory on the palate and offers juicy black cherry, raspberry jam and white pepper notes alongside smooth tannins. It's made to be enjoyed young, so drink soon."

"Aged for six months on its lees, this ripe smooth wine is both rich and crisply fruity. Balanced acidity partners the apricot and ripe pear. It is just ready to drink, although it will be better from 2018."
The wine is full of fruit that's soft and smooth. It has a broad ripe texture that is subtly contrasted with the acidity and more zesty character. The wine is refreshing and fruity and ready to drink.
"Bold and fruity, this wine shows the richness of the black fruits. It has fruit tannins, a lush texture and a dry core. With its density and its ripe fruit, it could age further. Drink from 2018."

"Aromas of apple cider, peach and oak lead to a full palate. Flavors of melon and banana have a nutty quality, while this is stable on the finish, with tropical fruit and honeyed flavors. Drink now."
"This opens with juicy pomegranate and cherry notes before bourbon barrel scents take hold. The midpalate seems to fade, then the flavors return on the finish. Give it another year or two in bottle to pull itself together."
"This Bonarda could be your everyday red or house pour with no issues. Solid berry aromas are fairly woody and a bit earthy. A bouncy, fresh palate is cheerful, while flavors of plum, blackberry, cassis and spices are toasty and forward-moving on the finish."
"The perfumes of Touriga Nacional dominate this soft, smooth wine. A layer of tannins gives structure, and the ripeness of the fruit creates a delicious, full-bodied wine."

"This non vintage white blend is composed of 50% Auxerrois, 40% Pinot Blanc, and 10% Pinot Gris. It has green apple and lemon pith aromas, lemon curd, apple juice and pastry flavors and a creamy finish."
"There is a great deal of restraint exercised in this bottling from this warmer SoCal region, with tightly wound blackberry, black currant and turned loam on the nose. The flavors are also still wrapped up firmly, with more black currant, asphalt and gravel hidden behind sticky tannins. This wine is still young and should age well."
"This well-made blend aged in 20% new French oak showcases red fruit, with cracker, coffee and earth suggestions. A hint of alcoholic heat comes through on the finish."
"Saucy, earthy berry aromas are full of oak and clove notes. This wine feels full but not too heavy, with solid overall balance. Blackberry, dark plum, toast and spicy oak flavors finish peppery and stout, with ripe, chewy tannins. Drink through 2022."
"At five years old, this is soft and supple, with well-integrated plum, cherry, spice and cola components. It's smooth and seamless and should be drunk soon."

"From a biodynamically-farmed vineyard, this frames its cola and black cherry flavors with gravelly minerality The dark, earthy components come up through the finish, and the tannins have a slightly herbal edge from 10% whole-cluster fermentation."
Earthy notes of pollen accent robust yellow peach and quince in this medium-sweet Kabinett. Fine brisk texture and scintillating acidity lend a lacy fragile feel to the palate. The finish lingers sweetly.
"This wine is alive with herbacious notes that give it a savory qualityâ€”cut grass and green olive blend effortlessly with rosewater and baked lemon. These are all well represented on the palate, which also offers a welcome green apple flavor. Good acidity and balanced weight offer a long and lifted finish, complex with character."

"Now reaching its maturity, this is a wine that shows tannins that have softened into spicy acidity, meaty flavors and a suggestion of wood. It is a dry wine, now ready to drink."
"Oddly acidic and hard in the mouth for Merlot, a variety that's supposed to be soft and silky. You'll find black cherry flavors, but not enough to punch through the tannins. Doesn't seem capable of aging, so drink up."
"Pale straw with a touch of green to its hue, this is a soft, easygoing Moscato redolent of oranges and pineapples. Finishes fresh and clean despite considerable sweetness."
"A pleasant, sweet little sipper, with more richness than many Australian Moscatos, balanced through a slight touch of bitterness on the finish. Orange and spice notes are joined by just a faint hint of berry fruit."

"Sweet, rich and oaky, marked by flavors of buttered popcorn, toast, pineapple jam and ripe apricots. Made in the modern style that will be liked by many, but not particularly sophisticated."

"The new oak barrel flavors stick out aggressively, and help to create a strong impression of drying tannins. The fruit is light and chalky, with young vine flavors of generic red berries."
"This Bolgheri blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah opens with raw, foxy aromas of cherry and sour fruit. But it also shows fine tones of root beer and black licorice on the finish."
"An herbal wine, crisp and green with an attractive citrus edge. Some yellow fruits show while it is the acidity and taut mineral character that is dominant."
"Riverbench's regular estate Pinot Noir, as opposed to their excellent Mesa reserve, has struggled over the years, and this '09 continues that pattern. It's elegantly structured, but somewhat underripe, with an asparagus edge to the raspberries, cherries and sweet oak."
"The label doesn't tell you, but this is from the Firestone family's Curtis Winery vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley. It's a very nice wine, especially at this price. A little too sweet, its orange, lime, lemongrass and vanilla flavors are balanced by crisp acidity."
"The Zephyr Ridge vineyard provides the fruit for this brambly Petite Sirah. It was aged for 22 months in American oak, and has that roughshod character, a mix of wild berry, garrigue and clean earth."
"Crusty and dusty smelling, with dark berry, plum and herbal aromas. Feels edgy and rubbery, then tastes like a mix of herbal black plum, dark cherry and oak dust. Finishes fiery, with peppery flavors and leftover oak."
"A little too sweet for comfort, with jammy orange, apricot and lime flavors. Brisk acidity and a savory minerality help restore balance, but the score would be higher if the finish were drier."
"Dark, burly wine, rich with dusty tannins and plump black plum fruits. The texture is soft, Porty in its sweetness, although the acidity retains freshness. With its juicy aftertaste, the wine could age for 1â€“2 years."
"Opens with grassy, slightly burnt aromas that later yield to hickory smoke and herbal berry fruit. Feels fresh but prickly, with grabby acidity setting up flavors of herbs, olive, woodspice and red berries. Finishes fresh and minty."
"Scratchy and a little sharp smelling on first impression, with vanilla and milk chocolate aromas in addition to standard red fruit scents. Feels firm, solid and basic, with dark fruit flavors touched up by young, simple oak notes. Standard and dry on the finish."
"Delicate notes of wood-grilled apples, walnut skin and lightly toasted brioche take center stage on this sparkler. Balanced and creamy in the mouth, with a nice streak of ruby red grapefruit pith unfolding on the clean finish."
"A ripe and juicy wine, the wood flavors giving considerable spice character. Acidity and blackberry fruits work into a wine that has an attractive, if rough-at-the-edges, character."
"Orange blossoms and toasted brioche tempt on the nose of this elegantly oaked Chardonnay. The palate is concentrated with pristine melon and floral flavors, and just a hint of dusty minerality in the backdrop."
"Marked by zingy acidity, this Malbec shows Cabernet-like black currant flavors and strong, rich tannins. Bone dry, it needs a good steak to punch through the astringency."
"Smells vegetal, with aromas of canned peas and beans vying for attention with mature tropical fruit. Feels mealy despite decent acidity, while the flavor profile is from the garden, meaning it's mostly about asparagus and green beans."
"Smells perky, prickly and tart, with sharp plum and raspberry aromas. Feels citrusy and pithy, with a cutting mouthfeel, and snappy flavors of berry and red plum. Tastes rubbery and slightly bitter on the finish."

"Soft, with a severe cut of acidity slicing through modest blackberry-jam flavors."
"Soft and thin, with rustic berry, tobacco and spice flavors that finish sweet."
Twin unbalanced notes of vegetables and raisins mar this Cabernet. It's very soft and finishes with notes of prunes and milk chocolate.
"This rustic wine is overripe in prunes and raisins, and hot in alcohol. It's also as sweet as a minor Port."
"Soft, with slightly dilute flavors of blackberry and currant, surrounded by oak. Turns vegetal as it opens."
"This rating is probably as much a reflection of tasting the wine too late in its evolution as anything else. At this mature state, the wine is heavy and syrupy, with stalky, almost bitter red-fruit flavors. Finishes with matchstick and grassy flavors. Wait for the 2011."
"Not quite ripe, with a green, vegetal streak cutting through the thin flavors of cherries. It's a soft, simple country wine."
"This southern Oregon Syrah has red-fruit aromas, with notes of perfume and plastic."
"A strange wine that's not very aromatic beyond basic pear fruit and grass. Feels basic and tastes both green and oddly sweet, with a short, oily feeling finish that ends bitter. Tasted twice with similar findings."
"Feels flat and syrupy feeling, with sweet, herb flavors that suggest blueberry and baked plum. Finishes herbal."
"A bit unripe, with some vegetal flavors along with the blackberries. There's also a lot of sweet heat from high alcohol."
"This is a rustic, soft Cabernet. It tastes hotter than the official alcohol level, which is 14.5%, giving heat to the blackberry and prune flavors."
"Sugary sweet and medicinal, like cherry cough syrup."
"Crisp but bland, with sharp edges and some bitterness on the finish."
"Overripe and Porty, with raisin, prune and chocolate flavors that finish hot and slightly sweet. The heat simply overwhelmed this Merlot."
"Flat aromas of red licorice candy, grass and maderized fruit are none too inviting. Feels chunky for rosÃ©, with sweet, wayward fruit flavors that come with a burnt stalkiness. Finishes bitter."
"Dilute, with simple strawberry flavors and a disjointed finish."
"Funky and odd smelling, with exotic aromas that are unfamiliar and not that inviting. Feels thick and soupy, with black fruit flavors, cumin, candy and some bitterness on the finish."
Aromas of strawberry sherbet are followed by sweet candy-shop flavors on the palate. Chill it thoroughly before drinking. Screwcap.
"Fluffy, sweet aromas of peach, pear and vanilla are as good as it gets. Tastes of powdered sugar and the most forced oak you can imagine. Not at all surprising that it's resiny on the finish."
"96-98. Barrel sample. The fruit is very pure with a great depth of flavor. This wine has weight, and intense flavors of dark plum and sweet fruit. Impressive."
"95-97. Barrel sample. A powerful wine with dark and dry tannins. It has a great depth of fruit flavor, with immense and concentrated weight, and a structure that is for long-term aging."
"95-97. Barrel sample. Showing new wood spice, this rich and full-bodied wine also has weighty fruit, with creamy and herbaceous qualities."
"This 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot is one of the best red wines produced in Umbria. The Lamborghini family (of automotive fame) delivers a plush, modernâ€”and yes, racyâ€”red with dark concentration and generous tones of ripe cherry, vanilla and sweet spice. It has a chewy, plush feel in the mouth with bright freshness on the close."
"A finely constructed wine that is likely to age over many years. With its juicy currant flavors still dominated by minerality and citrus, there is some austerity. It is a complex wine showing great terroir character from the steep vineyard site."
"This vineyard, the â€œway to the church,â€ gives a full, rounded wine with very pure, direct fruit, and a green structure. This is an impressive wine that offers minerality as well as big fruit."
"With 15% residual sugar, this dessert wine is decidedly sweet in apricot, pineapple, pear, honey, vanilla fudge and smoky flavors, with a brisk minerality. It maintains a zesty balance, with crisp acidity."
"Sagemoor's old Cab vines comprise 79% of the blend. The rest is a mix of Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, melded into a deep and satisfying whole. Beautifully mixed cassis, berry and cherry fruits are dotted with dried herb. There is plenty of caramel and toast in the lingering finish, and this wine combines hedonistic power with depth and character."
"Near perfect in the way it tastes almost sweet, then pulls back into dryness. The flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, peaches and honeysuckle are made even more delicious by the judicious application of new oak and sur lie aging."
"Here's a big, rich, densely layered Syrah, the kind of wine that Cab or Merlot lovers who are looking for alternatives should discover. It's full-bodied, dry and oaky, yet with its cherry, chocolate, fig and licorice flavors, offers a whole different flavor profile. Brilliiant with pork tenderloin with a fruity sauce or stuffing."
"A first from Pichler, this is a wine that stopped fermenting while still sweet and offers rich layers of honey, lychees and pepper are all here, as well yellow peaches and honeydew."
"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade."
"A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment."
"Bridlewood has crafted a very serious Syrah, from a region of Santa Barbara County that excels at this RhÃ´ne variety. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with rich, dense tannins, but what's notable is the depth of flavor. The blackberries, currants, licorice, cola, mocha and smoky oak flavors are very rich. Drink now and for a few years."
"Packed with superripe tropical fruits, this is a concentrated, powerful wine, with lychee and smoke flavors. There is intense acidity to counteract all the richness. Finishes sweet and ripe."
"Apartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines. This vintage is stunning; the black cherry and wild berry flavors are lively and honest, while the wine's structure is just where it should be. With a juicy steak or lamb chops, this wine will bowl you over."
"Rich in red currant, cassis, licorice, cola, vanilla cream and smoky oak flavors, with a smoothly tannic texture, this wine seems to be Cabernet-based. It's made solidly along Napa cult Cab lines, a softly voluptuous wine that's delicious now, and should age well for many years. From Hagafen."
"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also."
"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure. New oak adds just the right touch of smoke and vanilla to this ageworthy 100% Cab. Best after 2010."
"The blend is classic Bordeauxâ€”85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy."
"Dry, crisp and minerally, this Chard has intensely pure flavors of ripe white peach, pear, green apple and pineapple that have a stony scour of cold steel. It's the opposite of the modern style of oaky fruit bomb Chards, with an elegant integrity that's food-friendly and ageworthy. Fine now, and should do interesting things for a decade."
"Dry and soft, with the taste of cherry, roasted almond, crunchy granola and fig health candy bar. Enjoyable, but simple. Drink now."
"This has so much raw, rough oak flavor when first opened that the fruit is nearly invisible. Tempranillo may well have a real future in the Walla Walla Valley, but first it has to be freed from the woods. Give this plenty of breathing time."
"Oaky and strong in jammy fruit, this Chardonnay has potent pineapple, tropical fruit and buttered caramel popcorn flavors. It's also quite acidic. Would benefit from greater control and nuance."
"Tomato leaf, herb and spice aromas mix with green-leaning raspberry and marshmallow sweetness on the nose. The palate is gritty and tough, with salty, herbal cherry and brambly flavors. Short and choppy on the finish."
"Light and herbal, with a modest core of grapefruit flavors. Grassy notes soften on the finish, allowing some chalky notes to come through. Drink up."
"Made from Cab Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, this is a very flavorful wine, with rich blackberry, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors. But it's very sharp in acidity, with a jalapeÃ±o pepper burn that limits its appeal."
"Soft and simple, with slightly sweet pie-filling flavors of cherries and mocha. A decent, everyday wine for picnics, barbecue and such."
"Soft, fruity and simple, with blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors. Basically dry, but tastes as sweet as jam. Syrah, Cabernet and MourvÃ¨dre."
"A fresh, high-acid wine, with flavors of raspberry and apple. It's crisp, with fruit that is barely ripe. Needs plenty of chilling."
"Honey-sweet in orange and vanilla flavors, this wine has a good backbone of acidity that makes it crisp and clean. Drink it with vanilla desserts or even cheesecake."
"Opens with a mix of toast and dusty, herbal aromas, and with time it turns more saucy than precisely fruity. A bulky wine with a chunky mouthfeel and fleshy flavors of herbal plum. A late wave of tartness and more herbal flavors cements things into place."
"A fruity, direct Chardonnay that will appeal to fans for its peach, pear and oak flavors. Not especially complicated, but a fine example of the variety at a good price."
Cantina Tre Serre is a well-priced and informal Barbera with a thin and informal style backed by fruity freshness. There's even a tiny touch of effervescence that adds a perky and peppery sensation to the mouthfeel.
"A bright, creamy wine with light acidity and flavors of green fruits, pears and a strong streak of grapefruit."
"Tastes frankly sweet, with sugary flavors of pineapple marmalade, vanilla custard and butterscotch. It's clean in acids and spicy in the finish. If this is your style, enjoy."
"The old saying, you get what you pay for, is perfectly illustrated by this simple Pinot Noir. It's not bad, though, and at this price, will perform the useful function of introducing budding Pinotphiles to the variety."
"This seems to be an attempt at an Italianate style, with modest alcohol levels (11%) and the accompanying lack of fruit expression. It's largely neutral, with hints of underripe pear and white pepper that combine with chalky notes on the finish."
"â€œThe Affairâ€ refers to the relationship between the French and Italian varieties in the blend. Sadly, this isn't the hottest affair, with the strong game, red currant, strawberry hull, milk chocolate and smoky dried salami notes all downplayed by the lean mouth and waxy finish."
"Not disappointing given the price. There's some toast and tropical fruit on the nose, and then pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity runs a bit sharp, but overall this is a reasonable, warm-climate, tropical Chard for the money."
"Immediate aromas of chalk and peach waft up from the glass, followed by flavors of green lime and asparagus in the round mouth. The finish is a little heavy, but the flavors are nice and it should be a nice companion to summery soups and grilled vegetables."
"Nice herbal notes unfold in the bouquet with notes of lime rind, underripe peach and soft bell pepper coming through in the mouth. The finish is clean, like fresh-cut grass, and the overall experience enjoyable."
"A soft, approachable Sauvignon Blanc with aromas of yellow florals, ruby red grapefruit and yellow pepper. Riper peach flavors unfold in the mouth supported by solid acidity and a clean finish, Drink now."
"A bit broad on the palate, this wine offers ample melon and fig flavors but lacks that vibrant zesty character that so often sets Marlborough Sauvignon apart from the pack. Drink now."
"Firm and substantial on the palate, this is a complex Pinot, the red cherry fruit juicy and inviting and the wine layered in Chinese five-spice. Light in texture and weight the wine still offers a sense of place and gravitas."
"Pale in color, this is dominated by its taut, nervy structure. Crisp red currant and red apple flavors give the fruitiness. A ripe, full-bodied mouthfeel brings out a softer, riper aftertaste."
"Planted in 2001 above the Laguna de Santa Rosa near Sebastopol, Baranoff Vineyard is tightly spaced to mostly Calera-clone Pinot, providing the wine's bright raspberry and cherry overtones atop a layering of earth and spice. Thickly structured, it finishes with tart cherry."
"Kopke has an impressive quantity of old tawnies, some of which will have ended up in this wine. It certainly seems older than its 20 years with strong wood flavors, smoky toast and beautiful mature acidity. It is very ready to drink, a fine mature tawny."
"Soft and full-bodied, this offers bright apple and citrus fruits layered with toast from wood aging. Under the broad exterior, the wine is developing more tangy, zesty fruits and a tight texture. It needs to age to bring everything together. Drink from 2017."
"This is an austere wine, packed with tannins and tight acidity. The red fruits are right at the back behind the firm structure. A mineral character supports the dusty texture and suggests long-term aging. Drink from 2018."
"Oaky, heavily roasted aromas of hickory, baking spices, coconut and exotic black-fruit scents feed into a chunky but easygoing palate with spicy, barrel-rich flavors of hickory and vanilla as well as baked berry and leather. A ripe, slightly rubbery finish is generous. Drink through 2018."
"Already showing some toasty maturity, this blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir is delicate, yeasty and rounded. Coming from northern Burgundy, it has a cool climate feel, textured with orange zest and the crispest acidity. It is ready to drink, although another few years in bottle will improve it even more."
"Made from 80-year-old Glera vines that have never been doused with herbicides or pesticides, this boasts an enticing floral fragrance of jasmine and honeysuckle. The elegant, reserved palate has a pristine quality, delivering green apple, lemon zest, nectarine, pastry cream, herb and mineral alongside a fine perlage. It finishes crisp and clean."
"Fragrant and floral, this blend of 55% Chardonnay, 30% Pinot Nero and 15% Pinot Bianco offers aromas of lemon blossom, white flowers and toasted almond. The palate shows an impressive depth of flavors, including yellow apple, lemon cream pie and peach alongside an elegant mousse. The creamy flavors are brightened by lively acidity."
"An amazingly vivid nose of cherry, eucalyptus and morning dew on wild fennel promises a stunning wine in this clonal combo from Morgan. The flavors aren't quite so mind-blowing, though, as basic fruit-punch elements meet with touches of peppercorn and nutmeg."
"This is a full, round, woody bottling, with graphite, leather and mild herbal aromas. The palate feel is concentrated but also tannic and grating. Flavors of bold black fruits, herbs and barrel resin finish tight, with residual raw oak in abundance. Drink through 2018."
"Blanc de Noirs, white Champagne only from red grapes, produces wines with some weight, as here. It makes for a rich, full-blooded Champagne, packed with red fruits while also cut through with intense acidity. The fruitiness gains shape from a zesty texture."
"This is an elegant Champagne, with a burgeoning sense of maturity as well as fresh acidity. Flavors of ripe pear are cut with a light touch of lemon while the overall texture is soft and on the sweet side of Brut. It could age a few more years, so drink now and until 2019."
"Tilled earth, blue flower, leather, blueberry and cured meat aromas jump out of the glass of this concentrated wine. The rich palate delivers black berry, licorice, chocolate, clove and black pepper alongside firm, chewy tannins. Drink 2016â€“2023."
"This Malbec-led blend is quite oaky, thus maple, molasses and chocolate aromas ride high alongside blackberry and mild floral notes. In the mouth, this is quasi-syrupy and very rich. Flavors of baked black fruits and brown sugar finish sticky, with chunky weight. Drink through 2018."
"Scents of honey and freshly pressed apples waft from this delicate sweet Riesling. Bright, sunny peach flavor dominates the palate, but is pierced with a startling vein of lemon acidity. Finishes a savory with lingering notes of pollen and spice."
"Rubbery, foxy aromas of blueberry, blackberry, cured meats and spice are packed into an ideal whole. This Cab Franc is rich and flush in feel, with good acidity and balance. An herbal, saucy element accents core berry fruit, while the finish is full of coffee, chocolate, grilled meat and jammy berry flavors. Drink through 2020."
"Warren Dutton planted the first vineyard block of this Russian River Valley producer, the Pinot a combination of Dijon and Pommard clones. In the hands of new winemaker Jerome ChÃ©ry, the wine is exotic in spicy cinnamon and cardamom, earthy and herbal with layers of dark cherry."
"Made without adding the customary sweetening dosage, this elegant blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero opens with floral aromas of passion fruit, ripe pear and walnut. The subtle palate delivers citrus, Golden Delicious apple and toasted walnut alongside brisk acidity and a fine mousse."
"Smoke and crushed mineral notes open this dry, lusciously textured Riesling. It's slightly savory on the palate, with layers of apple and pear struck by zesty lime and lemon acidity. Powerful and structured, it penetrates long and lean on the finish."
"Already drinking nicely, this offers generously ripened peach, candied lemon and pineapple fruits. The lush flavors are balanced against fresh, natural acidity, with little or no time in new oak apparent."
"Perfectly capturing the AVA's signature mix of herb, leaf, wild berry and white pepper in a compelling nose, this rolls into a full midpalate that is flush with tangy pie-cherry fruit. Some tasters may find it pushes a bit too far toward the herbal flavors. The overall balance is lovely."
"Initial aromas are oaky and a touch raw, but soon they settle on raspberry and plum. This is a chunky, fruit-forward Mencia with dark berry, raspberry, spice, resiny oak and salty flavors. A full, lively finish is muscular but also fresh and bright. It had only eight months in oak; drink now through 2015."
"Beautifully perfumed, this has ripe blackberry flavors and a relatively dry character. The spirit is now well balanced, giving a backbone to the violet aromas and spicy character of this still-young LBV. It is good to drink now for its fruit, but it will improve and show more complex flavors after 2017â€“2018."
"A mixture of coconut, cedar and marzipan scents along with gritty, briary black-fruit aromas precedes a lively palate with weight, power and balance. Flavors of berry, plum and cassis are bold, oaky and chocolaty, while the finish hits hard with mocha, caramel and vanilla notes offset by bright acidity. Drink through 2018."
"This fun, delicious wine tastes generous in honey, pear, Meyer lemon, orange, nectarine and white flower flavors, which are balanced by zesty acids. The blend is Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier."
"This is nicely balanced and easy in terms of its tannins and overall intensity, with enough structure to pair with game meat or succulent red meat. The bouquet is redolent of spice, black fruit and crushed granite."
"This producer has a magic touch with its white wines, and this fresh Greco di Tufo is no exception. Mineral nuances are enhanced by notes of stone fruit, honey and citrus. A dusty touch of talcum powder appears on the close."
"This Pinot Noir stands out in a flight of German reds for its slightly fleshy, concentrated fruit quality. Bristling with acidity and a delicate layer of tannins, it's delicately structured but elegantly fruity, with hints of dried cherry and plum accented by rose and potpourri notes."
"A spray of sour cherry acidity and clean, gravelly minerality lend a tonic feel to this crisp, unabashedly cool-climate Pinot Noir. On the palate, delicate black-cherry and plum flavors are bolstered by layers of smoke and caramel that linger on the finish."
"Don't underestimate this wine. An Aglianico from Irpinia, it opens with pristine notes of black fruit, tobacco and crushed granite. The aromas are measured in intensity, but the wine's natural tannic backbone gives it importance and staying power."
"Big and forward on the bouquet, this has loud, fiery black-cherry and berry aromas. Like most Lurton wines of Spanish origin, El Albar is chewy and ripe, with a syrupy feel and flavors of blackberry, stewed plum and spice cake. The finish is chocolaty, beefy and concentrated."
"A little one-dimensional but still delicious, this has wave after wave of ripe cherry-pie flavor. Smoky, sweet oak brings an alluring vanilla note, and the mouthfeel is soft and silky. Try pairing this with beef tartare."
"Minerally as well as lemony and zesty on the nose, this is nevertheless neither pushy nor intense. The palate offers good acidity and razor-sharp clarity, along with flavors of pineapple and apple. Alert on the finish, this is a firm refresher."
"A high-toned whiff of Band-Aid opens into a broadly flavored wine, with notes of black fruits, baking spices and dark threads of charcoal and roasted coffee. Best for drinking over the next 2â€“3 years."
"A ripe wine from the Real Companhia Velha, this shows a rich character, its tannins ripe and generous. It's not a huge wine, but it does show a fine, full-bodied flavor of sweet plum. The final feeling is smooth and opulent."
"There is a strong underpinning of mineral in this wine, supporting crisply defined flavors of melon, pineapple and citrus peel. A medium-ripe, medium-weight, supremely well-crafted and balanced Roussanne."
"Ripe, rich and generous, this has tannins that show the basic structure of the wine, with chocolate and licorice flavors highlighting the wood infuence. At the same time, it has a delicious fruitiness."
"Already deliciously fruity, this is a big, ripe, black-fruit-dominated wine. To balance the black currant flavor, there is a fine sense of structure, which offers a dry edge along with final acidity."
"Sweet-tasting flavors of black plums and wild strawberries give this wine its initial charm. The tannins provide a firm structure under the attractive surface. It's rich, ripe and already a pleasure."
"Aromas of moist underbrush, violet, red berry and a whiff of espresso lead the way. The simple, somewhat diluted palate delivers fresh strawberry and a note of white pepper with easygoing tannins and bright acidity."
"This smells wild and yeasty, like sourdough bread blended with a hot summer field. Flavors of white fruits and melon are briny, while this closes with dry white-fruit flavors and peppery notes."
"Aged in large wood barrels for seven months, the wine is ripe and structured. It also has fine fruitiness, rich tannins and soft acidity. The wine will be better from 2017."
"This entry-level wine from Laurou is spicy and fruity. With a layer of tannins as well as attractive acidity, it is a wine to be drunk young. The aftertaste with its hint of licorice continues the spicy character that comes from the NÃ©grette grape in the blend."
"Basic plum aromas are woody and limited. This feels medium to full, with crispness and moderate tannins. Dry woody flavors of plum and currant finish with a freshening blast of lifting acidity."
"Soft and buttery, this medium-bodied Chardonnay smells like lemon meringue and tastes lightly sweet like marshmallows and bananas."
"Fresh and lively, this opens with vibrant scents of crisp green apple, white melon and lime. The palate offers riper flavors of pear, guava and nectarine, while brisk acidity keeps the mouthfeel bright and the finish mouthwatering. Drink now."
"Earthy aromas mingle with mandarin peel on the nose. The palate becomes broader with its earthy notes and grainy texture, with some definition from citrus pith. Drink soon."
"Attractively aromatic, this is a crisp blend of Colombard and Sauvignon Blanc from the same area as many of the Armagnac vineyards. It is fruity with a zesty lemon texture and so light and perfumed. It is ready to drink now."
"This attractive, family-owned estate has produced a fruity, crisp and light wine. With its orange-zest acidity, citrus fruits and a tight, mineral character, it is a light wineâ€”bone dry with just a touch of pepper at the end."
"Aromas of citrus and corn chips are a bit ponderous but do the job in advance of a citrusy, drawn-in palate. Briny grapefruit and orange flavors finish solid but salty."
"he nose on this Assyrtiko blend is feisty and spicy, followed a combination of tropical fruit, citrus and vanilla spice on the palate. The wine is fuller bodied but brisk on the finish. Appealing overall and a very nice week-day white."
"This blend of this wine is popular in Alentejo with Syrah now part of the repertoire. The wine is warm, with a ripe character and a sunny feel. Its structure and acidity keep the wine balanced. Drink now."
"The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals aromas suggesting wet underbrush, wild herb, new leather and a hint of woodland berry. The slender palate is rather raw and diluted, offering hints of tart sour cherry and star anise alongside brisk acidity and angular tannins."
"With a vineyard planted in the traditional Beaujolais style of individual bushes rather than trained on wires, this is a light, soft and fruity wine. It has attractive tannins and fresh red fruits. Drink now."
"Delicate scents of blue flower and red berry lift out of the glass. The slender, easy-drinking palate offers wild cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside soft, fleeting tannins and vibrant acidity."
"Herbal aromas of tomato leaf and earthy plum are a bit green. This feels chunky, with some grab. Herbal plum flavors are like the nose, meaning they lean towards green. Finishing flavors of olive, spice and herbs are common for value-priced Chilean Cabernet."
"Aromas of weedy underbrush, oak, menthol and a toasted note emerge in the glass. On the lean, one-dimensional palate, suggestions of vanilla and bitter almond accent raw sour cherry."
"The aromas are shy on this bottling, but with patience show gravel and blackberry juice. The mouthfeel is also a bit light, offering dark red and purple fruit alongside asphalt and espresso bean."
"Winemaker Ray Coursen is a Vietnam Vet, and this wine is made to honor other veterans of foreign wars. Soft, round and approachable on the palate, it's made from a majority of Merlot, with smaller additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Cedar, currant and a sweetness of vanilla fan out on the palate."
Cherry and raspberry aromas are fragile and sketchy but not broken. This value-priced Cabernet shows a midlevel palate with moderate concentration. Herbal plum and raspberry flavors finish easy.
"This wine has a good, deep color, lots of fruity aromas and flavors, and a smooth mouthfeel. It tastes grapy and jammy but dry, with light spicy accents to add interest."
"Produced from 20- to 30-year-old vines on terraces above the Lot Valley, the wine is structured and still firm. It has ripe tannins that are contrasted with stylish red fruits shot through with acidity."
"This is a sweeter and fruity take on the grape, beginning with a nose of fresh and vibrant boysenberry fruit and wet-asphalt minerality. The palate is tasty in a hedonistic way, but very primary, with flavors of fruit punch."
There is an earthy character to this wine. It gives a dry edge to the black fruits and crisp acidity. The wine has the tannins typical of the appellation although it also has a light herbal touch that is less attractive. Drink now.
"There's a subtlety to the bouquet of this wine, showing dainty scents of yellow apple, just-dried hay and orange peel. The palate offers more intensity and verve, with notes of citrus pith, melon rind and saline that linger softly on the refreshing finish. Enjoy now."
Some overripe fruit on the nose derives a little more shape from the lemon acidity of the dry palate. The body is slightly dilute but finishes clean.
"Lightly pickled citrus aromas include a note of pyrazines. Direct on the palate, with a reasonably good mouthfeel, this delivers short flavors of stone fruits in front of a finish that's mildly pithy and bitter."
"This Elqui Syrah is topped with resiny oak aromas that emphasize clove and nutmeg. Big, full-bodied, sticky and tannic, this barrel-heavy wine tastes charred, toasty and burnt, with chocolate and campfire notes to the finish."
"Aromas of moist earth, game and red berry lead the nose and carry over to the simple palate. Bright acidity and loose rather fleeting tannins provide the easy-drinking framework. Enjoy soon."
"A simple Merlot, it's easy to drink, and will be very nice with everyday fare like burgers or tacos. It's dry and tannic, yet rich in cherries and red currants, with a smooth coating of toasty oak."
"As fresh and fruity as possible, this is a lively wine. Coming in a darkened bottle it looks stylish on a table, although its fragrant red fruits make it even better as an apÃ©ritif."
"Savory scents, a whiff of animal and jammy berry aromas set up a large palate with choppy tannins and lots of breadth. This Malbec-lead blend shows roasted, rubbery black-fruit flavors and a fairly smooth but oaky finish."
"Dense aromas of prune and raisin scream â€œoverripe.â€ In the mouth, this is heavy, saturated and stewy in feel. Flavors of crÃ¨me de cassis and brandied cherry finish baked and raisiny. Drink now."
"Dominated by wood, it offers heavy oak and toasted sensations with a hint of butterscotch alongside fresh acidity, but it lacks fruit richness."
"Smoke and mineral notes lend a prominent savory tone to this wine, contrasting a palate that's sunny and sweet with pressed apple and pear flavors. It's straightforward in style, but refreshing with bright lemon acidity and a lasting iced-tea sweetness."
"This crisp, relatively light-bodied wine comes across as a bit lean in a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc context, offering hints of struck flint, grapefruit pith and underripe melon. Drink it over the next several months."
"Still settling into its skin, this wine shows a light effervescence when first poured that lifts the notes of freshly cut pear, mandarin orange and wild flowers. It drinks off dry, with the concentration of the stone fruit flavors somewhat wanting."
"Mineral in tone with faint apple and blossom aromas, this wine is demure, yet refreshing. The palate is moderately concentrated with white grapefruit flavor accented by zesty lime notes and a clean, wet-stone finish."
"The strong, green streak of gooseberries will divide wine lovers on this 100% stainless steel-fermented wine. It's absolutely dry despite low alcohol, with brisk acidity."
"Cherry and raspberry aromas are fresh, clean and simple. A juicy, direct palate brings cherry and plum skin flavors with citric acid for cleansing purposes. This rosÃ© is the definition of a simple summer quaffer."
"Aromas of acacia flower, honey and beeswax carry over to the palate along with mature yellow apple. It has an overripe quality and has already reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy now."
"Aromas of exotic fruit and apricot come with a whiff of hay and celery. The lean, simple palate offers nectarine and peach along with a note of bitter hazelnut."
"This is a very ripe Chardonnay, with pineapple, orange and apricot jam flavors. It's rich but not particularly subtle, with lots of new French oak."
"Lively and fresh, it is full of mousse and ripe peach and pear fruits. It has acidity, a light touch of sweetness and a hint of bottle age. Drink now as an apÃ©ritif, but it is better with food."
"Notes of thyme, cocoa and broad dark fruit lead to a malleable, medium-full palate. The finish conveys tang and iron."
"One-dimensional but pleasant, it's dry and brisk in acidity, with ripe cherry pie filling, pomegranate and persimmon flavors, enhanced with new French oak. With some heat from high alcohol, it will drink well through 2017."
"This wine is soft, herbal and earthy. It has a lovely smoky creaminess, as well as hints of white stone and tropical fruits, but lacks a certain vibrancy."
"Grown in a celebrated vineyard, this Pinot isn't showing well at this point. It's heavy and soft, and the raspberry-cherry flavors are compromised by a vegetal quality. Decant and drink up."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Aglianico from southern Italy delivers plum, raspberry, spice and espresso along with integrated oak sensations. It's easy drinking and made for everyday enjoyment."
"Scents of thyme, tar, date and ripe strawberry lead onto the open-textured palate. Medium in length, the finish comes with fine-grain tannins and balanced acids."
"Oxidative in style, this Vidal Blanc boasts aromas of cidery apple, toasted nut and brioche dough. Medium to full in body, this offers concentrated flavors and tart acids. Try pairing it with a wedge of goat cheese to tame its raciness."
"Fresh, fruity and forward, this wine is full of bright apple, peach and pineapple flavors. Dry in style with soft lemon acidity, it's quaffable and brisk, but finishes a tad short and simple."
"Whiffs of smoke lend a savory feel to pressed apple notes on this dry, delicately framed wine. The palate bristles with lemon-lime acidity and finishes long and lean with a hint of wet stones."
"A rather pungent, slightly sweaty nose presages a wine that offers loads of passion fruit flavor. While it lacks a bit of dimension and complexity, this medium-bodied offering will work fine alongside citrusy ceviches and the like."
"A straightforward wine with notes of plum, currant and herbs. The flavors are lighter in style supported by firm tannins."
"Typically spicy, this wine is all about intense perfumes. Very soft, ripe and rounded, it will be better as a sweet apÃ©ritif than with food."
"The aromas of this rosÃ© of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc are direct and reminiscent of red currant jam on toast. Medium bodied and broad in feel, this has acids that offer plenty of cut, plus a touch of grapefruit zest that adds interest."
"Muddled sensations of overripe lemon/lime, mature exotic fruit and smoked ham are accented with intense mineral and notes of balsamic herbs."
"Made from the native Albanello grape, this concentrated wine has yellow flower and exotic fruit aromas. The dense, slightly sweet and one-dimensional palate offers lemon drop, mature apricot and nectarine flavors that end on a sugary note."
"Now for something completely different. Wild strawberry leads the way aromatically on this lean, high-toned Cabernet, lower in alcohol than most of its peers. The fruit is tight and structured, the wine angular and soft, with a seasoning of herb on the finish."
"Mostly rich and broad in mouthfeel, this offers light, savory aromas of dried herb and sunbaked earth plus solid plum and red berry flavors. It features a full body, firm texture and flavor complexity."
"Gentle aromas of apple and fresh citrus give way to some autolytic yeastiness. Altogether, this is a very restrained but elegant sparkler, with soft mousse and a refreshing streak of acidity."
"This was fermented from dried Barbera, Sangiovese and Nebbiolo grapes, concentrating the flavors yet retaining an elegant lightness that belies its high alcohol. Mixed fig, raisin, soy and chocolate components lend extra complexity. It's drinking well and is perfect for near-term consumption."
"Well-made in an opulent, hearty style, this vineyard-designated Chardonnay is barrel-rich and full-bodied. Floral on the nose, and tasting of oak, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and vanilla extract on the palate."
"This structured Rosso has pretty aromas that include nectarine peel, black plum, red berry and violet. The palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry and licorice alonside firm tannins. It has a warm midpalate and is extremely accessible so enjoy now."
"In just a few years 14 Hands Riesling production has jumped from around 15,000 to more than 700,000 cases. Clearly the brand is doing something that consumers love. This is a fairly dry style, with forward, fruity flavors of ripe orange, apple and apricot. The length and concentration are spot on."
"Scents of violets and savory herbs add complexity to tart, juicy red cherries and plums on this crisp, elegantly framed Cabernet Franc. A touch of menthol highlights a cool, acidic edge on the palate. Finishes moderately long with a murmur of fine-grained tannins."
"This is all estate-grown from the original (2004) planting. Tannins are smooth and the wine has a pleasing chocolate streak upon entry. Peppery and herbal highlights come into play through the finish, which firms up nicely."
"Wild cherry, violet, underbrush and spice aromas lead the nose on this bright red. The palate is still tight and tannic but offers juicy black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon alongside vibrant acidity. Best after 2015."
"Delicious and easy-drinking, this straightforward wine opens with aromas of violets, wet soil and perfumed berries. On the palate, notes of white pepper and cinnamon add interest to the juicy, cherry-berry fruit. Fresh and smooth with silky tannins, it's best through 2015."
"Bright aromas of red berry, rose, orange peel and eucalyptus lead the nose and carry over to the straightforward, savory palate along with a hint of allspice. The juicy fruit is balanced by supple tannins. Drink soon."
"Full-bodied but easygoing, this opens with aromas of underbrush, meat juices and ripe berries. The soft, warm palate delivers juicy raspberry, crushed black cherry and baking spices alongside big, round tannins. It's extremely accessible so enjoy now. Petit Pois, Siena Imports."
"Pert and fresh with white floral and lemon tones, this dainty Chardonnay balances reverberating acidity with juicy tangerine and pineapple flavors. Refreshing and sprightly, it's the perfect year-round apÃ©ritif."
"Dark berry aromas are dense and a touch rubbery. This is a full, chunky, bold Cabernet with wild berry, cassis and woody flavors that meld together well. Finishing flavors of mint, licorice and oak are generous."
"Just a smidge over the edge into off dry, this is a big, juicy wine with a luscious mix of tropical candy fruit flavors. It's like tasting an entire roll of tropical Life Savers all in a glass. The residual sugar is offset with balancing acidity, and it's a versatile wine that can accompany a wide range of slightly spicy foods."
"This new vintage is head and shoulders better than the previous effort. Light and pretty, with a delicate mix of citrus, melon, tangerine, lemon and lime, it's showing good length and impressive detail."
"Aromas of plum, black berry, orange peel and a hint of eucalyptus waft over a thick layer of juicy, dark cherry accented with sweet baking spices. It's straightforward, round, ripe and ready. Enjoy this soon."
"Bready, yeasty, oxidized aromas open this up. In the mouth, this is elegant to an extent, with residual acidity keeping things alive. Flavors of white grapefruit finish round and smooth."
"There's a pleasant sweetness to the nose, a mix of white flowers and fragrant apples. On the palate, green banana, apple juice and papaya rise to the occasion. A strong minerality holds through the finish."
"Very fruity, fresh and easy to enjoy, this has the smoothness of barrel age but little overt oak flavor. It features bright red cherry and raspberry aromas, juicy berry flavors and a texture with just enough bite to be appetizing."
"Unusual aromas of blue fruits are matched against cardamom and cumin scents. The palate is blocky yet dominated by acidity, while flavors of plum, black currant and woodspice are exotic. A hard finish shows hickory and barrel flavors along with wiry acidity."
"Ripe blackberry aromas carry notes of prune and raisin. For a ripe, dark wine, this is juicy and well balanced. Oaky, toasty flavors lean toward dark fruits and blackberry, and the finish keeps the dark-fruit theme going while folding in bitter coffee notes."
"Light golden in color, this is exotic in ginger and lemongrass, with a midpalate of fresh-cut pear and wet stone. Gearing up to the finish, expect deeper tones of caramel and tropical oak."
"Some firm tannins give solid structure and smoky character to this wine, an exotic blend of Merlot, Abouriou and Malbec. The juicy berry fruits are round and full in the mouth. It's a ripe wine, with a solid structure that gives balance to the fruitiness."
"Vivid fruit flavors light up this extroverted Viognier, starting in the aroma and lasting through the long finish. It tastes like apricot, orange, pineapple, vanilla and cream. Good acidity keeps it lively and fresh, balancing the full body."
"This is a generous, ripe wine, full of red fruits and soft acidity. It's already enjoyable, but will benefit from aging until 2015 to bring out the refreshing fruitiness even more."
"Heavily wooded, the wine is essentially toast with a touch of fruit. Of course, it is young, and the rich black fruits behind all this smokiness will come through. Drink after 2019."
"Les Cimels is a solid, entry-level CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache. Blackberry fruit dominates this full-bodied red, picking up intriguing tarry notes and glancing those with crisp, citrusy acids. Long and mouthwatering on the finish."
"Dominated by ripe SÃ©millon, this is a rich wine. It has a touch of herbaceousness, but the yellow fruits, pears and stroke of lemon give a full-bodied, rounded feel. Wood aging adds further to the satisfying flavors."
"Damo has earthy fragrances of tobacco leaf, underbrush and truffle, along with notes of raspberry and spice. The palate shows ripe black cherry, vanilla and sweet spice flavors, as well as a hint of licorice. This has nice depth and balance, but will be more complex after 2017."
"Made by the winemaking team of Quinta de la Rosa, this powerful and bold wine comes from vineyards up river in Douro Superior. It is full of dark, dense black fruits and concentrated tannins with brisk acidity on the finish. Drink from 2018."
"This is a strong, firm wine with an initially earthy aroma that fills out with the scent of dark black fruits. The structure of the wine is taut, dark and brooding, offering serious potential for aging. Its bold acidity and young tannins further suggest aging, so drink between 2016â€“2024. Langdon Shiverick, ComÃ¨te Wines."
"You'll have to go far and wide to find a bigger, richer California Chardonnay. It's enormous, offering an explosion of tropical fruit, citrus and apricot, brightened by crisp acidity. Despite the power, the wine maintains elegance and balance. This is one of the few Chards that will take bottle age, gradually losing fruit. Drink nowâ€“2018."
"Typical of the best 2009 Riojas, this is aromatic with scents of berry fruits, graphite and spice all mixed to the right proportions. A well-structured palate features firm but flexible tannins and fresh flavors of plum, berry, spice and mocha. On the finish, darkness takes over in the form of espresso, peppercorn and bitter chocolate flavors. This can be drunk now but will benefit from another 5â€“10 years of aging."
"A gigantic Pinot Noir, rich and heady in black cherries, sweet licorice, bacon, mocha and toasty oak flavors, wrapped into firm tannins and brightened with crisp Santa Lucia acidity. It's a dramatic wine, but too young. Give it at least four years for all the parts to begin to come together."
"Now in golden maturity, this is a smooth, unctuous and ripe wine. Honey is the dominant character, a perfumed wild flower honey that is layered with intense acidity that lifts the wine in a beautiful way. A sweet wine yes, but one that is so balanced."
"Firmly in the style of the vintage, this is dense, full-bodied Cornas, with plenty of fruit. Intense plum, coffee and black olive notes dominate, while the tannins are ripe and plush. Believe it or not, this is actually drinkable now, yet should age easily through at least 2025."
"Sure, it starts out a bit toasty and cedary, but that wood will surely integrate with the potent plummy, meaty fruit given a few years' time. It's full bodied and a bit coarsely textured for the moment, but finishes long and will clearly benefit from cellaring. Drink 2018â€“2025."
"This shows floral and underbrush aromas of violet, forest floor and woodland berries. The palate offers ripe black cherry, red currant, Asian spice and toasted notes. It's structured yet elegant, with firm but fine tannins and nice depth. It's ready now, so enjoy soon."
"This is the most remniscent of Chablis among Testarossa's new Chardonnays. It's a minerally, chalky wine, bone dry and with lots of acidity, which makes it racy and clean. But it also has a solid core of ripe oranges and limes. It's fine to drink now, and could even develop mushroomy bottle complexity over the next six years."
"Awesomely rich in black cherries, plums, licorice, mocha, cola and sweet oak flavors. Made from selected barrels of the winery's various vineyards around the state, its richness is balanced by brisk acidity and a soft scour of tannins. Drink over the next six years."
"Mango aromas drive this rich wine, full of honey as well as spicy fruits. It is not so much weighty as intense, with a sense of warmth. Now mature and ready to drink, it still retains a youthful fruit character."
"This hallmark Chianti Classico boasts a heady perfume of violet, underbrush, peach blossom and clove. The palate delivers bright red fruit, pepper and cinnamon with crushed cherry in the forefront. It's nicely balanced and should develop complexity over the next few years but is already delicious."
"Massive fruity extract characterizes this Cabernet. With noble tannins and explosive black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it defines the modern Napa cult style of soft, delicious complexity. Good to go now, but you're better off holding it for 8â€“12 years."
"This is perfectly balanced dry Chenin. It has just the right amount of richness, aided by a touch of vanilla. The green and white fruits are blended with deceptively soft acidity to give a wine that feels full and ripe in the mouth. Good to drink now, but also worth aging for 3â€“4 years and more. Screwcap."
"Mango aromas and flavors give a sense of the sweetness of the wine. It is rich and full bodied, with spice and pepper notes just hinting at acidity. Keep the wine for 3â€“5 years."
"The name is an oblique reference to Shiraz, which forms the basis of this cuvÃ©e. It's inky in hue and rather reticent on the nose at first. But swirl it vigorously and be rewarded with layers of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Full bodied, rich and tannic, its blueberry and cassis fruit lingers on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink 2015â€“2025."
"Here's a classically crafted selection, with a lovely floral and earthy fragrance. The palate shows dark-plum and black-cherry flavors laced with white pepper, mint and balsamic accents. While it has tame acidity, it's still tightly wound and needs just a few years to soften and develop additional complexity; drink after 2015. Vi Wines, J & J Importers."
VV refers to the old vines that are at the heart of this impressive wine. It has great concentration both from the richly structured fruit and tannins. New wood comes through richly on this powerhouse of texture and density. Give the wine at least six years to mature.
"Floral and black fruit aromas are punctuated by spicy notes on the nose of this wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black-cherry, white pepper, mint and sage along with big but ripe tannins and edgy acidity. Give it a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2015â€“2020."
"An opulent feeling Riesling, full of peach and pineapple flavors. It's ripe, full in the mouth and textured, its richness masking the dryness of the fruit and the acidity. It could age a few more yearsâ€”give it 2â€“4."
"Retro makes one of the best, most consistent Petite Sirahs in California. Even though they used to source their fruit from Howell Mountain and this bottling now is from Pope Valley and Calistoga, it still shows the same qualities of complex interest based on impeccable winemaking. It's an amazing wine, dry, full-bodied and tannic, with a complex range of berries, currants, herbs and white pepper. Truly a Petite Sirah for Cabernet lovers. Drink nowâ€“2020."
"This Pinot Noir is from the far or â€œtrueâ€ Sonoma Coast, near Annapolis, north of the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. It shows its origin in the brisk acidity and delicacy of mouthfeel, as well as the fantastic range of wild red berry, cola, pine, nettle and white pepper flavors that change from second to second. New oak brings toasty, vanilla complexities and wood tannins. This is a delicious wine now, but will age gracefully for at least eight years."
"Ikon refers to Touriga Nacional's position as Portugal's iconic grape. It is almost black in color, and profoundly dense and dry with wood tannins at this early stage of development. Yet it promises a palate that's rich and smooth with fruit in time. It's intended for long-term aging so drink from 2017."
"A lovely, wine, with aromas of red cherry, violet and hints of underbrush. The palate delivers succulent wild cherry, cinnamon and natural vanilla flavors with hint of truffle. It has compelling depth but needs time to tame the structured yet elegant tannins. Drink 2016â€“2025."
"This is a smooth, impressively rich wine powered by silky tannins and ripe black fruits. The palate is intensely concentrated with a big, bold structure and a solid feel. It does need some aging, so drink from 2016."
"This gorgeous Chianti Classico boasts lively cherry, strawberry and violet aromas. The mouthwatering palate shows concentrated wild-cherry flavor layered with mint, white pepper and clove. It has fresh acidity and firm tannins that will develop complexity with more bottle age. A textbook Chianti Classico."
"Pale gold-colored wine from an exceptional vineyard. The warmth of the volcanic soil gives richness to the fruit while still keeping some feeling of dryness. It has weight, dried spice and pepper. Honeyed fruits show right at the end. Drink from 2014."
"Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity. It cuts across the palate like a squeeze of lime juice, tart and mouthwatering. Oak shows up in this equation as sweet buttered toast. Altogether, it's a complex, elegant, delicious wine that will develop bottle bouquet over the next 10 years."
"Calidonio is a fascinating and deeply layered wine that is remarkable off the bat thanks to its unique personality and compelling aromatic profile. Piedirosso (85%) is fermented in oak with 15% Aglianico to create tones of black fruit, spicy smoked meat, resin and black licorice. It is smooth and very soft on the close."
"Vintner Salvatore Geraci is the proud producer of Palari Faro, one of the great red wines to emerge from the Mediterranean rim and the island of Sicily. The elegance and finesse is extraordinary and the wine opens with a complex bouquet that sees petite elements of cassis, licorice, tar and tobacco rolled into one."
"Quite a good Cabernet, virgorous and dry, with an earthy edge of sweet, dried herbs alongside the blackberries and cedar. More elegant and food-friendly than many of the fruitier, high alcohol, oaky Cabs out there."
"A lovely effort from proprietor Raimund PrÃ¼m, this plump, creamy-textured spÃ¤tlese displays ample mineralityâ€”there's a distinctly slate-driven noteâ€”allied to ripe apple, stone fruit and citrus. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, this would be terrific with slightly sweet or spicy dishes."
"Spicy and assertive, this young, cellar-worthy Pinot Noir just hints at the complexity within. Give it plenty of air time and it opens aromatically with allspice, sandalwood, perhaps some cola and pine needle. The tart and tangy berry fruit is still compact and primary, but fully ripe and nicely sculpted into a well-defined wine from start to finish."
"Old vines, at least 60 years old, are the basis for this soft, wood-aged wine. The texture is smooth, with rounded tannins and density. Flavors include licorice, bittersweet chocolate and black cherries."
"This is firmly, tannic, the product of oak cask fermentation as well as aging. The tannins promise long aging, while the ripe black jelly fruit character brings out the richness of the vintage."
"A wine that combines the richness of the vintage with the extreme flinty texture of young, dry Chenin Blanc. Packed with ripe acidity, it is pure, very crisp, yet for aging."
"Made in a ripe, soft style that's unusual for Howell Mountain, this Zin could almost be Grenache, or even a big Pinot Noir. The cherry pie filling, raspberry cream and Dr. Pepper flavors are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's a luxurious, exotic Zinfandel whose heat from high alcohol adds a spicy element."
"Hails from Macul, so it exhibits some normal eucalyptus on the nose along with spice and pointed, slightly piercing berry aromas. The palate is chewy, sweet, modern and ripe, with chunky berry, herb, olive and particularly graphite flavors. Settles on big black fruit and depth. Outstanding Chilean Cabernet with individuality. Best from 2013-2016."
"A huge wine, explosive in ripe fruit, elaborated with rich oak and wrapped into smooth, sweet tannins. Made from vineyards throughout the county, it dazzles with a complex of blackberry jam, mocha, date, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors. Really impressive, especially at this price. Drink Nowâ€“2015."
"This Pinot Noir needs a few years in the cellar to mellow, although you can decant it now to let it breathe. It's very rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice and sweet, smoky oak, with a soft, silky texture. Shows a real sense of sophistication."
"A distinguished Cabernet whose superb tannins, which are firm and ripe and refined, testify to its Napa origins. So does the blackberry and currant fruit, which finishes in a swirl of sweet, smoky cedar wood. Good as it is, it's way too young. Should be best around 2015 and afterward."
"This interesting wine is an unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux varieties with nearly half Syrah. It does what Napa does so well, offering a plethora of ripe, delicious cherry, black raspberry, dark chocolate, sweetly smoked oak and peppery spice flavors that are deep and long on the finish. A lovely, accessible wine to drink over the next few years."
"A great Viognier, rich and exotic, showing the powerful fruit you want from this variety, in a balanced, elegant way. With a sweet, buttercream mouthfeel, it's brisk in acidity, with powerful flavors of tangerines, pineapples, golden mango and exotic spices, finished with smoky, sweet oak."
"From 29-year-old Pinot Nero vines, PinÃ©ro is an elegant and fine still red wine produced by one of Italy's most celebrated sparkling wine houses. Polished and finessed down to the smallest detail (those tiny berry aromas come forth so clearly), this wine shows the potential of the Burgundian variety in Italy."
Classic. Beautiful acidity is balanced by just a touch of sweetness. The wine is bright with apple and lime flavors.
"Very young, needs plenty of time. Still showing fermentation notes, with brisk, grapey acidity and primary cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Seems brilliantly constructed and capable of aging, though. Hold until after 2012."
"The combination of very high alcohol and what tastes like residual sugar gives this Grenache an excessively sweet, glyceriney taste. It's fabulously rich in raspberry cream, blackberry jam, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Very flamboyant and delicious, but really more of a dessert wine than a dry table wine."
"A field blend ice wineâ€”don't see that very oftenâ€”it's full-bodied, almost lush, and packed with mixed slightly candied fruitsâ€”tropical, stone fruits and citrus. Concentrated and poised, it balances on fresh acidity. Just a hint of plastic in the back of the finish."
"Camarato is a beautiful wine and the 2004 vintage shows impressive harmony and elegance. The wine opens with aromas of chocolate, black cherry and spice. In the mouth, it shows firm, enduring tannins. Pair it with a succulent steak."
"The upside of the recession is that wines this good are being sold for lower prices, which is great news for consumers. This Cabernet, basically a nÃ©gociant's blend, is really delicious. It's rich, dry, tannic and lush in blackberry and cherry tart, chocolate and smoky cedar flavors."
"The best Clos Pegase Sauvignon Blanc in years. Made with a little oak, just enough for creaminess, it's marked by vibrant acidity and complex, lovely flavors of lemongrass, Meyer lemon candy, vanilla, white pepper and the distinct minerality that Carneros white wines often display. Great price for a wine this sophisticated."
"A finely crafted wine, its tight acidity generating a very fresh profile. There is an intensity of fruit as well as a mineral texture. For aging. Screwcap."
"The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness."
"A real bruiser of a Zinfandel, dark in color, dry and tannic, brimming with massive flavors of wild blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and pie spices. The tannins are hard, in the way of this mountain. Drink Nowâ€“2013 before it loses fresh fruit."
"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito styleâ€”grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss."
"Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and â€œSuitcase clone La Tacheâ€ on its tech sheet. Vibrant and spicy, with cherries galore (sounds like a James Bond heroine) and a round, full, lush and satisfying mouthfeel. This is the one to drink now, while you cellar the CuvÃ©e Giselle."
"Named for a beautifully restored castle and boutique hotel in Abruzzo, this beautiful Italian white (made with Trebbiano grapes) shows a delicious creamy texture with abundant aromas of stone fruit, honey and toasted almond. The wine is thick and textured on the close."
"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir."
"Somewhat hard-edged wine, showing the sharpness of young Chenin Blanc. It has a future, though, as this edge drops away, because there is some good weight as well as bright fresh final acidity. Keep for several months."
"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety."
"With no oak, this wine's inherent fruit stars, showing citrus, melons and peaches. With crisp acidity, it's clean, brisk and entirely dry, despite relatively low alcohol. But it's strong in those perfumed pyrazines that turn some people off."
"Juicy and extracted, with bright jam tones and an open-knit structure. There's plenty of berry fruit here and a nice plum tone to the palate that carries over to the fleeting finish. A good choice for a big crowd."
"At 2.3% residual sugar, this is nicely balanced between sweet and dry. The fruit links peach, apricot and pear with a honey in tea streak that carries into the finish."
"Great nutty aromas come from the glass and follow into the palate of this sweeter style of white Port. It is rich, packed with almonds and a tangy orange zest edge."
"Here's a light and refreshing Rosso di Montalcino with sharp notes of berry, cherry, wet earth and violets. You'll also get some distant mineral tones that add dimension and personality. Pair this easy-drinking wine with your favorite home-cooked pasta dishes."
"This red wine, named for the chef at the winery restaurant, is fruity and high-toned, with lots of cherry and berry flavor. All neutral oak, soft tannins, ready to drink."
"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous. The palate is well balanced and the flavors run sweet, ripe and chewy, with berry fruit and creamy licorice notes on the finish. A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Garnacha from Catalonia."
"A solid value, the Marquee Victoria Chardonnay has an appealing restraint, hitting pretty high notes on the nose but turning serious and weighty in the mouth. The cream and papaya flavors reach a nice intensity before fading to a mouthwatering finish of guava and pine nuts. Drink now."
"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side. Flavors of baked berry, earth, caramel and coffee ring true, and the dry, toffee-tinged finish is a nice ending. Ready to go now."
"As with the Avery Lane Merlot, this is a rather complex blend, here including Syrah, Cab Franc and Lemberger. Fruity and spicy, with strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Very pleasing picnic wine."
"A nice, rich Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now with lots of different kinds of foods. With some new oak, it has fruity-sweet flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, apricots and lemongrass, with a tang of gooseberry."
"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast."
"A fresh-faced wine, bright with berry fruits, a light layer of tannins and a soft, easy texture. There is some stalkiness but this is great as a delicious, easy wine."
"Rich in berry, cherry, cola, pepper and sandalwood flavors, but a bit off in texture. Feels jagged and angular, with some green tannins. Ready now."
"Very oaky and very ripe, offering a flood of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance and a clean, brisk mouthfeel."
"Showing pure tropical fruits with a squeeze of lemon, this is a ripe, tasty wine, maybe a little short on acidity, but bringing out ripe lychee and mango flavors."
"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish."
"Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar. But there's a little streak of green unripeness that suggests aging will lead nowhere. So drink it now with big, lusty fare."
"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo."
"A very nice, likeable and super-drinkable Sauvignon Blanc, at an everyday price. Nicely crisp and just slightly sweet, it shows fruity flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, pears and melons."
"Barrel-fermented in neutral wood, this gives a quick whiff of buttered croissant, then dives into a moderately ripe palate with lime, pineapple and lemon rind. It's an all-purpose and appealing wine that is drinking nicely right now."
"This opens with aromas of hay, pressed yellow flower and orchard fruit. The direct palate offers yellow apple skin, toasted nut and a mineral note alongside invigorating acidity."
"Closed and youthful, this wine is medium in build and subtle in oak. It conveys a briny streak throughout the palate, and a distinct taste of candied lemon."
"Gold with copper hues, this opens with aromas of wildflower, tangerine zest and a whiff of crushed stone. The vibrant palate offers rennet apple, lime, ginger drop and a hint of mineral alongside mouthwatering acidity."
Arinto is the real local grape of the small city of Bucelas where this quinta is located. This fresh wine shows its light mineral and citrus character very well. It also brings out riper fruit flavors that fill it out and give it a rich character. The wine is ready to drink now.
"Thick, rich and ripe in vanilla, the American oak in this wine is pronounced and intense, wrapping itself around notes of candied apple and toffee-caramel."
"Grapefruit, mineral and freshly cut grass aromas lead the way. On the palate, brisk acidity supports pink grapefruit, tangerine and a mineral note."
"It's the delicious, clean, crisp fruit that's so good about this wine. It is bright with acidity and crisp apple flavors along with a lemon tang texture giving a fine bite. Stylish and fresh, it is a fine apÃ©ritif wine in style."
"Pear, white flower and crushed rock open on the nose. On the vibrant palate, a mineral note wraps around a core of crisp apple while bracing acidity provides the backbone."
"Intense aromas of pressed broom, dried herb, hay and a whiff of tomato vine come together in the glass. The palate is fresh but rather closed, eventually revealing yellow apple skin, mineral and a saline note."
"Aromas of toasted nut, citrus and oak lead the nose. The linear, rather lean palate shows yellow apple skin, bitter almond and lime zest. A mineral note signals the finish."
"Fresh and fruity, this lively white offers aromas and flavors of green Anjou pear, Granny Smith apple and white peach. Zesty acidity gives it a crisp, tangy finish."
"Delicate varietal aromas of tomato vine, cut grass, citrus and yellow stone fruit come together on this lively wine. The linear palate offers green melon, juicy grapefruit and a hint of tangerine alongside zesty acidity."
"Rhubarb and cranberry fruit, along with a touch of red apple suggests minimal ripening. It's a tangy, pleasant wine, light and optimal for near-term drinking with simple poultry dishes."
"A fresh, citrus flavored wine with attractive fruitiness and a crisp texture. There is a yeasty edge that should vanish and leave just fruit. Because it is mainly made from Chenin Blanc, there is a nutty, honeyed aftertaste."
"Aromas of apple, spring flower, bread crust and crushed rock come together in the glass. The brisk palate offers unripe Kaiser pear, citrusy notes and mineral set against a backbone of racy acidity."
"This is a tangy, not entirely varietal wine that's dense in black tea and black fruit, with layers of tobacco and dried herb. Give it time in the glass to open."
"Pomegranate, dark plum and slate show on the simple nose of this appellation blend. The palate is light, with hints of strawberry and plum as well as pencil lead and mace. It's a great option for chilling a bit and drinking on the beach."
"This waxy, heavily oaked Chardonnay regularly pulls the same score. This vintage has aromas of grapefruit, quince and garlic. Blasting oak and modest acidity result in flatness, while oak resin is by far the dominant flavor, with creamy apple and pithy bitterness lurking."
"The nose of this lively white is a combination of delicate aromas of wildflower and orchard fruit while the bright palate offers tart Granny Smith apple, tangerine and a hint of crushed stone. Vibrant acidity carries through to the crisp finish."
"Apple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now."
"Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age."
"This Bordeaux-style blend is 25% Merlot, the rest an even split between Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Stiff, tannic and earthy, it delivers robust flavors of herb and bark more than ripe fruit. With its assertive tannins, it should stand up well to a grilled tri-tip."
"A juicy, fruity wine that is named after the Knights Templar who built a magnificent castle and convent in the local city of Tomar. It is fresh with red berry acidity and some perfumed tannins. It should be ready to drink soon, but wait until the end of 2016 for the best results."
"Leather saddle wafts from the glass atop ripe cherry, blackberry jam and brown sugar. Tightly wound in tannin and oak, this wine becomes pleasantly juicy on the finish."
"The nose is a bit shy but reveals delicate scents of citrus and a whiff of peach blossom while the vibrant palate displays crisp apple, tangerine and a hint of steely mineral. Brisk acidity gives it a clean, refreshing finish."
"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose. Once sipped, it's like sucking on a purple-flower candy, with more lavender as well as plum and a pencil-lead edge that cuts through the palate."
"Delicate but alluring scents of spring flower and orchard fruit lift out of the glass. The palate is linear and rather lean but still refreshing, offering pear, yellow apple and mineral alongside bracing acidity. It closes crisp and clean."
"Fresh and lively, this opens with aromas of jasmine, tropical fruit and a whiff of flint. The vibrant palate offers crunchy Granny Smith and candied lemon alongside brisk acidity. A mineral note energizes the crisp finish."
"This is a thick, rich and very ripe wine, with a charred back note making its way against higher-toned tastes of red raspberry and blackberry. The oak is integrated and the wine softly varietal, but it packs a punch on the palate."
"Sharp, prickly aromas suggest tart red plum and wild herbs. The palate is a bit heavy and sticky, with sweet, gummy, medicinal berry flavors. Finishes bitter and peppery, with a medicinal aftertaste."
"Tomato leaf, rhubarb and herbal aromas come in front of a tight, tannic and prickly palate with green, spicy berry flavors. Turns hot and smacky on the finish, with carob and herbal flavors."
"Pretty good for the price, with jammy cherry, berry, cocoa and spice flavors. An easy Zin to drink with BBQ or pasta with tomato sauce."
"A heavy, sweet Zin. With 16% alcohol, it tastes like a simple Port, with raisin, blackberry and chocolate flavors."
"Salinic and minerally on the nose, with a hint of peach. The palate is wet and light, however the flavors run stalky and tart, with green banana and bitterness leading to a chalky finish. Quaffable."
"Red plum, tomato and brambly herbal aromas set up a snappy, astringent palate with strained raspberry, spice and herbal flavors. Very dry and acidic as it transitions to the finish. An herbal, sharp-edged red."
"Salmon colored, with somewhat flat aromas of peach and sweet melon. Sweet on the palate, with weight and thickness along with cantaloupe and a candied aftertaste. Finishes chunky and flat; tasted twice with inconsistent findings. This note reflects the better bottle."
"Overtly sweet, with a white sugar edge to the citrus fruits, this is basically a dessert wine. Earns extra credit for cleanness and crisp acidity."
It's all about oak in this Chardonnnay. Not much going on beyond the obvious attempt at flattery with buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Maybe a little peach and pineapple candy thrown in for good measure.
"Light red wine, with a stalky black currant character. It is very fruity, showing herbs and soft tannins. Almost an apÃ©ritif red, certainly one for lightly flavored dishes."
"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre is unbalanced. It's sweet in dessert red berry fruit, with an awkward streak of acidity."
"Sweet and syrupy smelling, with maple-covered doughnut and muddled spice and tree bark aromas. The palate is more cutting and acidic than expected, with a sheer mouthfeel and heavy vanilla and oak flavors covering up underdeveloped red fruit notes. Hard, crisp and tannic stuff."
"Heavy and stalky smelling, with burnt aromas. The leaden palate is weighty and short on freshness; tastes pithy and stalky, with some nectarine and plum thrown in. Seems to be fading."
"Funky with prune and tobacco overwhelming any fresher fruit, this Livermore Zin is high in alcohol (15.8%), which coats the tongue for a long time after the wine goes down."
"Simple and sweet, with jammy pineapple, orange and apricot flavors leading to a soft, honeyed finish."
"Sweet red plum aromas are candied and jumbled. The wine is clacky in the mouth, with a lot of acidity and narrow, sweet cherry flavors. Shows heat and burn on the finish. 50% Tempranillo-50% Merlot."
"A soft Vinho Verde, with white fruit flavors, only light acidity and some final sweetness. An attractive apÃ©ritif."
"A clumsy wine that aims for white Bordeaux in style and falls far short. There's plenty of oak and lees, but the underlying wine is thin and disappointing in citrus flavor."
"Earthy and tealike, with those attributes framed by charred, nutty oak. It's supple enough to be balanced for immediate consumption."
"Soft, sweet raspberry fruit-flavored wine. It has a line of acidity while its main character is the light, sweet aftertaste. Screwcap."
"Yellow Tail's sparkler is an aromatic blend of Semillon, Traminer, Viognier and Trebbiano that manages to be largely neutral on the palate at the same time it's perfumed on the nose. Frothy and off dry."
"On the dry side, with caramel and strawberry flavors, this is an attractive, bright rosÃ©, as fresh as they come."
"Smells earthy and leathery, with a grilled meat element to the nose. The palate runs sharp and high in acid, with narrow plum flavors. Doesn't offer a whole lot on the finish. More rubbery and tart than ideal."
"Herbal and green peppercornish, with dark berry flavors and herbal-vegetal notes. Light and crisp; complex for the price."
"Starts out with leather and cheesy aromas, and beyond that there's not a lot of fruit on the bouquet. It's a chunky, heavy wine with thick, jammy plum flavors that have strong herbal undertones. Warm, grabby and baked on the finish, which is plodding."
"This is a less formal Vin Santo. The wine is creamy and thick, with sweet syrupy notes of chestnut, honey, maple, candied fruit and dried apricot."
"Dominated by its dry tannins, this is a tight black currant and dark plum skin-flavored wine, surrounded by a firm core of tannins, a firm and dark-hued wine."
"There is great structure here, with dusty tannins percolating through the rich wine. It has power, concentration and density, with cocoa and cherry flavors well integrated. Think about aging for 1â€“2 years."
"This weirdly named wine is a blend of 95% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot. It's a bit soft and melted in texture, like liquid licorice, with flavors of cherries, red currants, mocha, anise and smoky oak, and the finish is dry. Notable for the elegance and purity of its tannin structure."
"Big, dark and brash, and very much in the modern California style, meaning it's rich, creamy, oaky and full-bodied. The nose brings toast, heat and potency, while the flavors are saturated, spicy and revolve around wild berry, tea, spice, caramel and savory warmth. Only gets better as it opens and airs; drink now through 2012."
"Opens with heavy aromas of raisin, prune, leather and chocolate. The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste. Toasty and a little gritty and tannic on the finish, and ultimately it's a little sweet but still impressive for Chilean Syrah."
"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% GrÃ¼ner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish."
"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic. The nose brings richness, smoke and black fruits, while the palate is juicy, focused and forward, with black-fruit flavor galore and a slight creamy character. Drying and toasty on the finish, with snappy acidity through the final drop."
"Pure, perfumed wine, its floral currant flavored fruit dancing in the glass. There is a bright lift to this delicious fruity wine, just demanding to be drunk. Screw cap."
"A solid, dense wine, packed with tannins and with a dry core. The soft fruit has flavors of strawberry, hinting at richness to come. At this early stage, tannins and acidity are still forming. Hold for five years."
"There is a voluptuous edge to this generous wine. It has rich flavors, some strawberry and plum juice. The final extreme freshness shows through the layer of firm tannins. For aging over 4â€“5 years."
"Made from the winery's little vineyard on Atlas Peak, this 100% Cabernet needs time to come around. It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine."
"A ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape-style RhÃ´ne blend that really nails it for satisfaction. Rich and fruity, spicy, yet with great structure. Defines the vintner's art of blending, comprised of five varieties sourced from a dozen vineyards. Fun and serious at the same time."
"This is a great value in a Petite Sirah that shows how well the variety performs in a great vintage in a warmer climate. With 20% Syrah, which seems to add richness and nobility, the wine is bone dry and elegant in mouthfeel, with complex blackberry, black currant, grilled beef, black pepper and cedar flavors. Drink now."
"This 60-40 blend of Trebbiano Toscano and Malvasia Bianca offers a traditional interpretation with thick sweetness and aromas of roasted chestnut, caramel and honey."
"This is a robust and firmly structured Syrah with medium-coarse tannins and medium-full weight. Meaty and dark with notes of licorice, black currant, sweet spice and a touch of cocoa on the finish. Though it's intense, it still feels like it's holding back a little bit; try after 2012 for a more forward presentation."
"The Cartizze cru is known as the best area for growing quality grapes for Prosecco. This precious expression shows drying mineral tones backed by sweet fruit, melon and peach. The soft, creamy quality if the perlage is also noteworthy."
"Big, structured and solid, with powerful dense fruit, this is packed with plum juice flavors. The wine feels chunky, while the acidity keeps everything in proportion."
"With hints of mint, and a firm structure from wood as well as tannins, this is a flattering wine. The tannins are rich, layered within the jammy black berry fruits. This is a wine for aging, but is deceptively attractive now."
"Since the futures tasting in 2009, the wood element has been tamed. It is still an important factor, but the fruit has blossomed, showing a solid core of tannins, surrounded by dark plum and red fruit flavors. It will need many years, but everything is here now."
"You need to give this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon time in the cellar. It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the â€˜05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years."
"Just the kind of Sauvignon Blanc the valley produces so well. It's flavorful in citrus fruits, peaches, golden mangoes and honey, yet balanced with racy acidity. The dry, crisp finish makes it an ideal cocktail sipper."
"If more Syrah tasted like this, more people would drink it. Beautifully ripe and soft, pure and rich in cherry and raspberry liqueur, smoke and pepper flavors. Ready now."
"Inky dark in appearance and concentration, this muscular Recioto della Valpolicella Classico wraps your tongue tight with its blockbuster power and persistency. Aromas include blackberry jelly, chocolate, cola and exotic spice. It finishes with smooth firmness and loads of personality."
"A pleasant wine that shows a sweet, spicy apricot nose; on the palate it has an interesting smokiness that works well with the fruit, and although there is a fair amount of alcohol, the fruit just manages to cover it, and the wine moves to a pleasant if not particularly long finish."
"A lightweight Sauvignon Blanc that fits the standard Marlborough profile, with slightly grassy notes layered over grapefruit and pineapple flavors. Drink now."
"Light and fruity with pineapple, melon and apple. This fruit forward, food-friendly wine has natural acids and a delicate balance. For the money it is a fine choice to accompany seafood, poultry and pasta salads."
"A nice wine, good and dry. It has forward peach, pineapple, apricot and oaky vanilla and caramel flavors, and a finely acidic finish."
"Thickly textured and rather sweet, with superripe apples and pears that at times seem almost drenched in honey. Probably best on its own, well-chilled as a hot-weather apÃ©ritif."
"Big, bold and soft, this is way too heavy. Sure, the GrÃ¼ner spice is all there, but it is at the expense of a fresh, racy character. The toast character doesn't quite work either."
"The Valdinara is a soft, seductive wine showing plenty of jammy fruit, and a pleasant smoky spice. On the finish it is a touch stemmy, but it is so slight that it adds an exotic edge to the wine. Pleasant, not very intense and easy to like."
"This is a heavy, bitterly tannic young wine that shows ripe blackberry and coffee flavors and spices. The raw astringency makes it tough now, fit only for greasy foods like barbecued ribs. It should age well for a long time, but will never quite overcome its rustic profile."
"The Ratti proved to be a rich, pleasant, gentle wine, showing lots of plummy fruit, not much acidity and a medium finish. The wine will marry well with a variety of foods, thanks to its hefty texture and its easygoing personality."
"Chiarlo tends to be one of the more reliable producers in Piedmont, and this comes across as a pleasant everyday wine. The fruit is very ripe, bordering on the superripe; but on the palate, the wine has some interesting flavors, dark cherry fruit and hints of licorice and green olive."
"The Pertinace offers a a soft, spicy nose of blackberry jam, vanilla and cinnamon. A pleasant, everyday, food-friendly wine that can be drunk now but has the structure to improve for a year or so. Imported by MW Imports."
"The Pertinace evolved nicely in the glass; at first there are simple lime peel aromas, but over time, they become richer and slightly more complex. On the palate there is pear, as well as the lime and an interesting smoky quality. Crisp and with good balance, the finish is a little short. Imported by MW Imports."
"The Einaudi is a fairly hefty version of a Dolcetto, having lost some fruit but gaining an interesting earthy character to the palate. Structurally a little on the chunkier side, but with good concentration. The finish is solid but dominated by the earthiness. Should be drunk soon."
"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled. The wine tastes acidic and sharp, with pineapple and citrus dominating, and a chalky, tannic finish. Perhaps it's just a matter of time?"
"This RhÃ´ne blend is soft and sugary sweet, with a honeyed, vanilla fudge and smoky oak edge. The underlying wine flavors are of peaches, pineapples and yellow apricots."
"Like its vintage predecessors, this seems to have some residual sugar, which gives a honeyed sweetness to the peach, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. But it has a very crisp, pleasant acidity that keeps the wine lively."
"Tangy acidity is the star here. It gives structure and backbone to the lemon, lime, pineapple and fig flavors, and makes the wine a great cocktail sipper."
"Sweet and frothy, and made quite close to the Moscato style, meaning the nose is full of flowers and lime. The palate is a mix of crushed children's vitamins, mango and ripe melon."
"Very laid back, the nose shows some mango and pear, but you really have to go looking for them. In contrast, the palate is almost pushyâ€“this is a big, fat intense wine. Essentially quite simple, but very tasty. Short to medium finish."
"Flighty and delicate on the palate, this refreshingly mineral semi-sweet wine is juicy with sweet apple flavor accented with brisk lime acidity. Hints of honey  and white flowers linger softly on the finish."
"Horsey, leathery aromas are earthy and funky, although with time blackberry notes rise up. The wine is lively, tough and offers bracing acidity. Flavors of herbs, licorice and lemony acidity support core blackberry fruit, while the finish is herbal and woodsy, with dark notes of espresso and black licorice."
"Delicate lavender and herb notes perfume this pretty off-dry wine. It's delicate in profile, but flavors of tart yellow stone fruit and blossom gain intensity on the palate with a streak of lemon-lime acidity. It concludes with a refreshing mineral tone."
Minerally black plum and boysenberry aromas set up a rubbery palate with medium weight and intensity. Generic but happy flavors of blackberry and cassis finish with dry spice and rubbery notes  as well as length and freshness.
"Precise yellow grapefruit, currant bud and apricot notes lead onto the medium-bodied, zesty palate. The grapefruit note remains dominant on the palate, and the lively acids give it a vibrant edge."
"Aromas of brick dust, tobacco, red flowers and cassis come with a touch of herbal green scents. This feels healthy and balanced, with flavors of herbal berry and currant. Things turn a bit saucy and more herbal on the finish."
"Nicely dry and tart in acidity, this pretty wine is fine to drink now. Flavors recall citrus fruits with richer notes of papayas, along with gooseberries and green mint from cool-climate grapes. Made without the malolactic fermentation, the wine was coopered in 55% French oak."
"A fruity wine, it shows ripe red berries, red currants and refreshing acidity. So while the wine has weight, it is also totally fresh and crisp. It's a rosÃ© for food, rich while balanced."
"Very salmon pink in color, this lively, crisp wine has some weight as well as refreshing fruit. It is full-bodied, with citrus and raspberry fruits, dry and very fresh at the end."
"This bright wine reveals fragrances of white flower, pear, citrus and slate. The juicy palate offers grapefruit, lemon-lime and mineral. A succulent finish closes on a note of white almond."
"Salt air, lemon pith and lemon blossom lead in this 100% Malvasia Istriana. A wave of citrus and pronounced juicy grapefruit flavors refreshes the midpalate. The finish is zesty and lively."
"Roughly half stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc and half barrel-fermented SÃ©millon, this has noticeable sweetness that puts a sugary edge on the flavors. Pineapple and Meyer lemon fruits are round and full-bodied. This should be chilled to cut down some of the sugary flavors."
"Fresh floral and apple notes are showered with zesty lime and lemon on the nose of this bright, invigorating wine. Dry and medium-bodied in style, the palate boasts hints of freshly cut grass and green apples that lend an herbaceous touch to concentrated grapefruit flavors."
"A savory wine, it features aromas of lemon zest, stone fruit and hazelnuts. The palate offers lemon-lime, pear and pink grapefruit accented with mineral and an almond note."
"Bright, playful berry and plum aromas are clean and fruity. Fresh and juicy, it shows firm but not jagged acidity. Flavors of ripe plum, berry, cocoa powder and herbs finish in forward fashion and not too oaky."
"There's a lush, decadent edge to this wine, thanks to heady aromas of vanilla cream, chocolate-covered raspberry and boysenberry preserves. The palate shows more restraint, with textured, fruit-skin flavors of plum and cherry that finish slightly chewy. Enjoy this now."
"The aromas are surprisingly light for the variety with notes of ripe pear and peach. It's full bodied with sweet fruit flavors and a rounded, creamy feel leading to a warm finish."
"On the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, the Celilo Vineyard is an exceptional site for Chardonnay. This was sourced from the 1983 planting, and the relatively old vines and cool vintage deliver a wine with excellent minerality, lift, drive and focus. The fruit is tangy and yellow/green, but perfectly ripe; the acid underpinning is fresh and lively. This has every chance of cellaring until 2024 or later."
"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish."
"Dusty, yeasty aromas of red apple skins, cherry and chocolate lead to a solid and true palate with a good bubble bead, moderate elegance and full flavors of plum, red apple, cherry and spice. This is full-bodied Cava with a smooth, robust finish."
"This Hawkes Bay wine seems to be trying to out-Marlborough Marlborough. Scents of crushed tomato leaves are aggressively green, while the acids are crisp, to say the least. That said, it comfortably rides the border between pleasure and pain, ending with notes of razor-like lime juice and soothing, dusty chalk."
"Polished and sleek, this wine opens with tropical fruit and citrus aromas. The steely palate offers grapefruit, lemon zest and nectarine alongside energizing mineral and fresh acidity. It has a clean, refreshing finish."
"This garnet-colored wine conveys aromas of cranberry, black cherry and bramble. Flavors of dark cherry, cranberry and black plum have a strong acidic backbone and a long finish."
"From a vineyard in the Green Valley, it has ripe flavors of apricots, tangerines, peaches, pears and Meyer lemons, with lots of smoky, honeyed notes of new French oak. Not very subtle, it will appeal to fans of oaky, ripe Chardonnay."
"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up."
"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine. It's light but polished, with pretty scents and flavors of rose water and raspberries. The generous acidity of the grape keeps it lively and fresh."
"With minerally, clean aromas of lemon-lime and seashell, this is ready for summer sipping. A tangy, citric palate offers pure orange, tangerine and lime flavors, with mango thrown in for moderate sweetness. A citrusy, cleansing palate is exactly as it should be."
"A crisp, clean and direct selection, this offers great purity and definition. Bright aromas of lime, white melon and apple carry through to the brisk, well-balanced palate, with faint hints of hay and ginger-like spice on the close. Drink now."
"Sultry, smoky oak accents the ripe fruit core, full of apricot, peach and pear aromas and flavors. Notes of vanilla custard and orange oil add depth to the medium-weight palate, with brisk acidity that shines on the long, spicy finish. Drink nowâ€“2016."
"It begins with aromas of mature tree fruit and spring flowers. The palate delivers a wave of Bartlett pear, peach, yellow apple, nectarine and mineral accented with hints of aromatic herbs and supported by fresh acidity."
"Raspberry, oak, wood spice, vanilla and herb aromas are followed by plump, jammy red-fruit flavors that provide appeal."
Sinewy texture and bright acidity meet a funk of blue cheese and forest in this interestingly complex and affordable wine. The earthiness continues in streaks of tart cranberry that ride along the palate.
"Full bodied, dark and tannic, this is a big wine with aromas and flavors of grilled herbs, black pepper, wood and earth. It feels broad on the palate, has a firm, fine-grained texture and lingering peppery flavors."
"Aromas of cherry syrup, cola and cinnamon emerge from this bottling, which features artistic labels that always impress the eye. The palate shows dark red fruit and baking spice, as well as a minerality that combines rust and gravel."
"Green-apple skins and grapefruit rinds introduce the nose of this wine, followed by a bit of tropical papaya and melon. The palate show more apple skin and tangy lime as well as a tight minerality."
"A blend of half and half Chardonnay and AligotÃ©, this is a mineral textured wine that is shot through with acidity and green fruits. It is crisp, light and bright, and refreshingly ready to drink."
"The aromas are light with notes of herb, citrus and tropical fruit. The palate is a bit more generous, showing pleasing herb and tropical fruit notes accented by tart acidity."
"Brooding aromas of incense, cedar, herb and cherry are followed by lithe fruit flavors. It's a deft expression of the variety."
"A blend of vines grown on granite and richer gabbro soils, this is a full wine, with creamy white fruits and acidity that is fully integrated into the smooth texture. Crispness comes through at the end to give a bright aftertaste with plenty of acidity."
"The wine is ripe, balanced and likely to be ready to drink soon. With its plump fruitiness and texture, it is a full wine. Rich red-berry fruits are gently balanced by acidity and supported with a light layer of tannins. It will be very drinkable from late 2017."
"The wine comes from the highest point of the slope above Santenay, giving it an attractive cool and crisp character. With its delicious, refreshing acidity as well as ripe pear flavors it is balanced, minerally and with fine acidity. The aftertaste confirms that the wine is ready to drink."
"This young, fruity and spicy Cabernet Franc is perfumed and ready to drink. The wine is structured, tight and offers delicious red fruit. Drink the wine, lightly chilled, with salmon as well as meat dishes."
"Round and ripe, this opens with fruity aromas of ripe apple and yellow stone fruit. The soft juicy palate delivers peach, pineapple and banana while a hint of mineral signals the finish."
"Aromas of chamomile flower, Spanish broom and orchard fruit lift out of the glass. The ripe palate offers exotic fruit, juicy peach and a note of candied citrus zest."
"Aromas of herb, pear, apple skin are followed by spritely fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
"Lemberger has become something of a signature variety for this winery. Aromas of orange peel, leather and red fruit are followed by plentiful Band-Aid and red-fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
"This wine is a blend of Grenache (46%), Cinsault (31%) and Counoise. A very pretty pale peach color, it offers quite light aromas of strawberry and watermelon. The flavors are sleek and light, capped off by a tart finish."
"Dark cherry, herb and medicine cabinet notes lead to bright cherry flavors. The tannins provide some chew."
"Roasted, gritty aromas of bacon and spicy oak are burnt on the surface. This is fleshy and full in body, with moderate acidity. Herbal, minty, lightly green berry flavors have a rooty accent and oaky makeup. Finishing flavors of mint and raw oak blend into herbal berry leftovers."
"Nectarine, apricot and botrytis aromas are sound but familiar. Round, full but not quite sticky, this tastes like toffee, honey and pear, with baking spice flavors, nutmeg in particular, on the finish."
"Sultry vanilla, smoke and bergamot notes thread languorously on the nose of this intensely perfumed Chardonnay. The palate is more subdued, showing zesty red apple and lemon anchored by a crisp acidic backbone. It's a touch woody now but could balance out with a few more years of bottle aging."
"Deep ruby in the glass, this wine offers a bouquet of cassis and strawberry. It is bright at first sip, but chalky tannins quickly make their presence known amidst flavors of black cherry, anise and juniper berry that come to a head in a pleasantly bitter apple-peel finish."
"Yealands is based in the Awatere Valley, a subregion of Marlborough that offers generally cooler, later ripening than the main (Wairau) valley. This is a fresh, sappy, medium-bodied Pinot Noir, featuring notes of cherry, vanilla and herb. It should provide easy quaffing over the next few years."
"Aromas of oak, mint and cola accent earthy black-fruit scents in front of a palate that's tannic and raw but firm and structured. Berry and salty, oaky flavors finish with grabby, drying tannins and peppery spice."
"Ripe earthy aromas of raisin and oaky vanilla open this heavy, saturated Tannat that displays jagged tartaric acidity and heat (15.5% ABV). Stewed berry, raisin and vanilla flavors finish full, tannic and chunky. All in all, this seems a bit overdone and overripe."
"Hot pink in color, this wine offer plentiful aromas of cherry and watermelon. It drinks off dry, with sugary sweet-fruit flavors that provide appeal."
"This opens with aromas of grilled herb, resin, stewed plum and cooking spice. The robust palate delivers raisin, dried black cherry under spirits, licorice, tobacco and dried sage alongside bracing grainy tannins that clench the finish."
"Earthy aromas of raisin, blackberry, barnyard and animal are dense. This feels clampy, grabby and heavy, with just enough acidity to maintain a sense of balance. Salty, savory plum and berry flavors finish with a final wave of salt and earthy, roasted berry fruit."
"The oak is at the fore of the aromas, with notes of vanilla, toast and spice along with cream. The flavors are full bodied with a lightly creamy feel."
"One of the Chronic brothers' most beloved bottlings, this blend of 46% Syrah, 27% Grenache, 22% Petite Sirah, 3% MourvÃ¨dre and 2% Tannat shows vibrant and fresh aromas of boysenberries, cola and lavender on the nose. It's easy to enjoy once sipped, with red currant, red plum and cranberry flavors gaining depth from oregano and marjoram herbs."
"Made from 85% Grenache and 15% Syrah, both from Kick Ranch Vineyard, this salmon-colored quaffer was fermented in concrete, and is hard to describe aromatically, taking its time to open. Dry, it tastes of watermelon and a hint of clove-like spice, remaining fresh on the palate and lightweight."
"Crisp in citrus, with noticeable tension that softens in the glass, this wine offers tremendous value and elegance. Medium bodied and well integrated in terms of oak and power, it has a lovely note of preserved lemon on the finish."
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, this wine is aromatically brooding, with notes of pencil lead, barrel spice, herb, medicine cabinet and cherry. The flavors are rich and full bodied, showing concentration and depth."
"Rich and fragrant, this is perfumed with white flowers and lemon blossom. Apples, crisp pears and lime give a fresh and tightly fruity taste. The aftertaste is bright, while also rich. Drink now."
"With the majority of the fruit from the producer's Calistoga and Oakville estate vineyards, as well as its Healdsburg property, this is a dry, citrus-laden wine, zesty and refreshing in lime and grapefruit. The acidity is dialed high, yet remains balanced by the density of fruit and body, the overall effect just right in terms of ripeness."
"This is a nicely blended mix of 37% Zinfandel with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. The kitchen-sink effort rewards in juicy red fruit, herbal, cedar accents and medium-bodied weight and tannin strength. The finish is lengthy in vanilla and smoke."
"Like a genie released from the bottle, this wine rises up with aromas of violets, herbs, cranberry and bittersweet chocolate. The palate has tart, vibrant acidity along with a silky feel with little apparent new-oak influence to interfere with the fruit and savory flavors. It's a pretty wine that needs to be paired with food to be fully appreciated."
"While five years from harvest, this bold, penetrating Merlot is still a baby, with a long, promising future ahead. Subtle whiffs of crisp red cherry and mushroom seem quiet on the nose, but the palate is deeply concentrated. Black plum and cherry flavors are penetrating yet deftly grounded by a core of mouth puckering tannin and acidity. Enjoy starting 2020, but should maintain for much longer."
"Vibrant aromas of black plum, cassis, dried leather, licorice and herb lead to full, sweet, soft-feeling dark fruit flavors that linger."
"Knights Valley continues to be a fine spot for this variety, as evidenced by this wine, which is extremely vibrant in grassy lemon zest and melon. A pure expression of the grape, it offers enough oomph to remain consistent and textured, ending with a succulent suggestion of apricot."
"Aromas of ground pepper, clove, mature plum, black currant and charred earth emerge on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend, with a whiff of game. The palate delivers dried black cherry, blackberry extract, licorice and grilled herbs alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. A tobacco note marks the close."
"Fresh and structured, this offers aromas of ripe dark-skinned berry, mature plum, violet, coffee and baking spice. On the smooth palate, notes of chocolate, chopped mint and clove accent the black cherry core. Bright acidity and fine-grained tannins provide balance and structure."
"Here is a hefty, concentrated, satisfying wine to pair with big proteins. A dense red-black color, with aromas of blackberry jam and dried plums lead to bold fruit flavors, full body and a thick, nicely tannic texture. The intense plum and blackberry character lasts through the lingering finish."
"Aromas of scorched earth, overripe black-skinned fruit and a whiff of game lead the nose. The palate is fresher, offering fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, dark cooking spices and a hint of menthol. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide support, while a tobacco note signals the close."
"Dried leaf, cherry, woodspice and medicinal aromas are followed by supple, sweet cherry flavors backed by lightly grainy tannins and a tart lick of acid. It's an intriguing wine that keeps you coming back for more."
"Made in a stainless-steel, grassy style, this features a charming balance of peach and apricot buzzing in the background to maintain the fruit amidst the natural acidity. Delightfully drinkable, it finishes lean and crisp."
"A mix of fruity notes immediately hit: white currant, gooseberry, apple and citrus. The palate is slender and fizzes with those primary fruit flavors that have overtones of meadow flowers. This is frothy, refreshing and fun on the surface, but there is serious backbone and intent."
"Leather and cooked meats open the nose of this wine from Southern California that also shows aromas of blackberry extract. Once sipped, it offers dark and dense flavors of sweet tar, concentrated violets and a pinch of lavender, all held together by grippy tannins."
"Several varieties figure into this blend, from 26% Zinfandel and 21% Syrah to smaller amounts of Merlot, Petite Sirah, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Big and powerful in smoky leather and black currant, it offers a rich softness on the palate, with a tightly wound savory, peppery aspect to the finish."
"Herb, dark raspberry and flower aromas take the lead on this young wine that saw just five months on neutral French oak. The cherry flavors are plush in feel, lingering on the finish. It's a very understated wine that appeals to the senses."
"A 60% majority of Zinfandel plays nicely with 40% Petite Sirah, blending into a happy union of big, ripe blackberry and thick tannins. Smooth on the palate, with a touch of vanilla, it highlights red and black fruit in complementary waves, staying juicy throughout."
"This powerful blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc by longtime urban winemaker Benjamin Silver comes together in a big way. Aromas recall rosemary-crusted beef, boysenberry, sweet tar and, thanks to the oak-aging, both caramel and vanilla. The rich palate shows black cherry, black raspberry and a pinch of tarragon."
"Rounded by small amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this Cab is earthy and lean on entry, before developing in the glass into juicy dark cherry and leathery notes. Smooth, integrated oak and tannin leave an impression in terms of texture, with a persistence of tannin on the finish."
"A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Malbec, this wine has aromas of berry, cocoa and vanilla. The cranberry and cherry flavors are tart and full flavored with a velvety feel."
"From flint and clay soil, this full, ripe wine is tangy, packed with fruit and still young. It is elegant, with the tight mineral structure giving a bright edge to the rounded fruit. Drink this intense and generous wine from 2017."
"This wine makes a big impression with wild, earthy aromas and dense, fruit-laden flavors. It blends ripe plum, smoke, tart blackberry and rich black cherry notes on a base of firm tannins and fresh acidity. These are rich, complex and carry through to the lingering finish. It's made from 85% MourvÃ¨dre, plus Syrah, Grenache and Counoise."
"Just-cracked, yeasty sourdough bread and dried lemon-skin aromas float off of this bottle-aged sparkler from an esteemed, longtime producer. Her winemaker son named this wine in honor of her birth year. An oxidative warmth gives bready depth to the palate, which shows lots of toast and lemon marmalade flavors."
"Complex tannins confound the palate at first, but mellow on the back side, inviting gregarious amounts of leather, black pepper and blackberry, a waft of cigar smoke in the mix, too. Fuller-bodied in style, the wine will benefit from time; cellar through 2020."
"Plum, cassis, floral hints and spicy, charred aromas open this Syrah-led blend. Hailing from a warm year, this feels jammy, dense and full in body. Peppery, chocolaty blackberry flavors end dark and deep, with a strong aftershock of olive and herbal flavors. Drink through 2019."
"Cocoa, vanilla and baking spice aromas lead off this wine, along with plum. On the palate rich, textured dark fruit flavors intermingle with barrel spices. The fruit and oak have equal footing."
"Mint and tarragon come to the fore aromatically in this vineyard-designate, a soft, approachable mix of juicy plum, red berry and chocolate. Fuller in style and ripe, it'll do well on a table of grilled and roasted fare, finishing with a kick of black pepper."
"This leads with leesy flavors of melon and stone fruits, followed by mild citric acidity that drives the palate. Flavors of stone-fruit pits and nectarine are a touch bitter, while the finish is minerally, with a shot of lemon zest."
Aromas of exotic fruit and fragrant white flower lead the nose. The straightforward palate offers tart green apple and juicy citrus alongside lively acidity.

"Both mineral and herbaceous, this is a crisp, taut and textured wine. It shows a tangy character, lemon zest and bright acidity. It's still too young, so drink from the end of 2015."
"Similar to the winery's regular Pinot Noir, this is moving quickly along the aging curve. Hints of strawberry fruit are cloaked in barrel flavors of mocha and cracker. Drink soon."
"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice. From the cooler Coombsville appellation, it is soft, round and on the paler, thinner side of Napa's ripeness spectrum, more restrained."
"The inaugural vintage of this wine, named for a water goddess, this offers herb, grass, lemon and peach around a medium body influenced by some oak. As it develops in the glass, tropical fruit unfurls in a refreshing spritz before settling down to a tart finish."
"Always an easy, light and fruity wine, this is full of peach and apple flavors. It is lightly textured with tangy orange zest and full of fresh, crisp acidity. The wine is ready to drink."

"Spicy and floral on the nose, this is surprisingly round and soft for an Australian Riesling, but still attractive. Try it young as an apÃ©ritif, where the gentleness will subtly prime your palate for things to come."
"Cranberry and strawberry rise to the top of this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend in terms of aroma and flavor, the color and weight of the wine light ruby red. Dry tannin and herb intermingle around a soft texture before becoming puckering on the finish. Small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc are within the blend."

"Baked pear and honeysuckle combine around a floral, perfumy vibe, the wine medium in weight, texture and body. A crisp and lemony finish rounds it out, the wine structured and soft."
"Cherry-berry aromas are floral but also a bit furry and volatile. The palate on this uncommon blend feels fruity but also like grapeskins, meaning rubbery and pinching. Equally rubbery flavors of black plum and berry fruits turn mildly bitter on the finish."
"This wine has been in bottle a while, perhaps to round out its flavors components, which tend toward candied cherry and spice. Aged in American oak, the tannins remain tight-grained and the aromas focused, but the wine falls somewhat flat on the finish."
"Sharply aromatic with peppery herb, bramble and thistle, this has a substantial core of cranberry fruit. Tannins are chewy, and the earthy, herbal characteristics, along with unintegrated oak (both French and American) dominate."
"This huge, fruity wine is packed with tannins and superripe fruits. It's a big wine in all senses, from its massive structure to its bold red berry flavors. There's a ripe, juicy end to this powerful wine."
"Lemon and freshly squeezed lime give this attractive wine a crisp, bright texture that is rounded out at the end with perfumed flavors from the Moscatel in the blend. This fruity, textured wine needs a few more months before drinking. Drink from late 2015."

"From Charlie Chenoweth's own vineyard site comes this tiny-production white, thickly textured in caramelized apple and pear with an oaky imprint at first. Dense and intense, it takes time to unwind in the glass to show more nuanced aspects of corn mash and clove."
"Shy and reserved on the nose, this wine is invitingly smooth and velvety in texture, with an intensity at its core. Anise, black tea, rose petals and cherry pie all figure in, with a juicy succulence making it pleasurable from first sip to last drop."
"This wine combines 42% Merlot with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Franc. It is inviting in juicy red berry and currant, with accents of lavender and herb. Full figured, it offers additionally compelling layers of subtle spice before a focused finish."
"An almost sweet oakiness rounds the corners of this full-bodied, lavishly flavorful wine. It wafts vanilla and chocolate in the aromas, ripe black cherry and dark chocolate on the palate, and a lingering baking-spice character on the finish."
"A touch of spring blossom perfumes notes of smoke and struck flint on the nose of this Kabinett. It's delightfully zingy, casting darts of lemon-lime acidity through flavors of sweet tangerine and apricot. The steely, mineral-toned finish is exhilarating and long."
"Subdued smoke and earth tones on the nose contrast the concentrated tangerine and crunchy peach flavors in this bristling Kabinett. Lithe and lean, it boasts a piercing lime backbone that is exhilarating to the senses. Delicate honey tones soften a lingering finish."

A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero, the sleek, polished palate delivers ripe lemon, nectarine, rosemary and a mineral note alongside bright acidity. It finishes clean and dry."
"While a tad more slender in frame than many of 2015's single-vineyard Kabinetts, this delicate Riesling offers a zesty punch of sweet-tart tangerine and quince flavors. It's irresistibly thirst quenching, finishing on a salty tang of mineral and lime."
"This well-balanced nonvintage Champagne from this major producer in the Aube region is dominated by Pinot Noir, giving rich character and structure. Red apple and ripe melon flavors mean everything is in place, making for a wine that is deliciously ready to drink."
"This bone-dry wine is made using Pinot Noir skins to give its salmon-pink color. It is dry and tightly crisp, compared with the brut nature cuvÃ©e also made from Pinot Noir. The ripe red fruits give a fruity character that balances the dryness. Like many really dry Champagnes, it needs to age to soften the intensity of the acidity, so drink this bottling from 2017."
"Deep and concentrated, this full-bodied wine has a noticeably dark color, big aromatics like cedar, black cherries and tobacco, and mouthfilling flavors that combine savory, peppery elements with very ripe fruit. It is rich enough to coat the mouth and linger on the finish."
"A very agreeable, satisfying blend of ripe fruit and firm texture makes this full-bodied wine a winner. It has enough concentration to drench the palate with blackberries and linger on the finish with cinnamon accents."
"Crisp and quenching, this opens with aromas of white spring flower, ripe orchard fruit and a whiff of cake spice. The fresh, silky palate doles out ripe apple, pear and citrus zest alongside an elegant perlage. Bright acidity lifts the juicy fruit flavors. It's savory and incredibly easy to drink."
"Toasted bread crust, citrus blossom, honey and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this wine which is a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero. The palate offers Golden Delicious apple, nectarine, hazelnut and dried herb alongside firm, persistent bubbles."
"This is the driest wine in an already-dry range of Champagnes. With no dosage, it is crisp, tight and mineral. The high proportion of Pinot Meunier in the blend brings out the the flavors of white fruits and the crisp texture. The bottling is still young and will be better from 2017."
"This is a rich wine made from a selection of Pinot Noirs, including some from grand cru vineyards. It is textured with hints of tannin as well as yeast and minerality, concentrated while also stylish. Ripe pear and apricot flavors are lively and ripe. A young bottling, it's worth aging until 2017."
"Taking advantage of recent warm vintages, Boizel has joined other producers in taking its range drier. This extra brut is full of crisp apple and lemon flavors. It is dry, although the acidity is balanced by the ripe fruitiness and mineral aftertaste. Drink this bottling (disgorged January 2016) from 2018."
"This proprietary red combines equal portions of Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah with smaller amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Altogether, they form soft, spicy waves of full-bodied flavor, showing off characteristics of leather, black pepper and clove, with the tannins intrusive and lengthy."
"Fruity and spicy, this is a finely wrought wine. Structured and concentrated, it will develop well, giving a solid wine with tannins as well as blackberry fruits. Drink this SÃ©bastian and Nicolas Carreau wine from 2019."
"For an appellation blend, this is a nicely complex bottling. The nose offers toasted almonds, lemon twist, lime pith, browned butter, light pineapple and the slightest touch of dairy. The sip starts off slightly sour, framed with sizzling acidity and a savory salty character, conveying flavors of lime peels, wet slate and just enough melted butter on the finish."
"Strawberries, red currants and root beer come out at first, with cherry soda bringing up the rear. This forward, fresh and fruity wine is drinking well right now, and should be consumed through 2019."
"A blend of Chardonnay and Arinto, this wood-aged wine is rich and packed with both toast and fruit flavors. Vanilla and apple and citrus acidity are generously pulled together by the mineral texture and ripe structure. The wine will be best from 2017."
"This producer based in the small CÃ´te de SÃ©zanne has produced a bright, zesty and crisp style of blanc de blancs. It emphasizes fruitiness, lively with only a light touch of chalky minerality. It is full, ripe, fruity and ready to drink."
"Produced from a field blend of Douro varieties, and foot trodden in open granite fermenters, this is a wine that has an excellent future. It also has such delicious juicy black fruits that it could be drunk soon. Ideally, though, keep this ripe sweet wine until 2026."
"Peppers and cloves accent cherry-berry fruit on the nose of this single-vineyard wine. On the palate, it's full bodied and deep and silky in texture, with a long spice-inflected finish."
"In the crisp, balanced style of the producer, this nonvintage Champagne is light, poised and elegant. It is satisfyingly mature with good acidity and minerality. Lively and perfumed, it is ready to drink."
"Delaforce is a long-established brand that first appeared in the US in the 1930s though it came on the European market in 1878. The wine is sweet with that fascinating old wood character of an aged tawny. Toffee, spice and dried fruits give it a wide range of flavors. The wine, ripe and balanced, is ready to drink."
"This chocolatey sexy wine tastes of cherries and sandalwood, with a strong dark chocolate note. A hint of pine needles comes out in the bouquet, and although it's already drinking well, it will surely improve with a few more years of bottle age."
"This ripe wine is full of minerality and rich white and yellow fruit. Still young, it's deliciously creamy and bright, showing great potential for aging into something serious. Drink from 2020."

"Bright red fruits like raspberries and cherries light up the aromas and flavors of this deeply colored, nicely concentrated and velvet-textured wine. It has great fruit that wells up, fills the mouth with flavor and then hangs on for a long finish."
"Forest floor, scorched earth, dark-skinned fruit, menthol and ground clove aromas come together in the glass. On the structured palate, youthfully assertive close-grained tannins support wild cherry, black pepper, licorice and espresso. This is still austere and needs to unwind to show its true potential. Drink 2020â€“2031."
"One of the top wines from this producer, this blend of at least 10 grape varieties comes from its estate. The wood aging has added sophistication to this already concentrated wine. With black fruits to the fore and firm tannins, it will age well. Drink from 2019."
"Baked black plum, dark strawberry and baking spice show on the well-integrated and elegant nose of this bottling by New Zealand-raised winemaker Fintan du Fresne. A chalky mouthfeel carries forth flavors of bright boysenberry fruit, loam and more brown spice, elements that are sure to gather more power with extended bottle age."
"Winemaker Bruno Corneaux keeps a tight grip on alcohol levels, without sacrificing ripeness, flavor or balance. This aromatically compelling wine jumps up with scents of sea breeze, toasted nuts and buttered popcorn. Flavors follow, with apples, vanilla and toast coming to a full-bodied lingering finish. There's ample length and tension to age gracefully for another decade."
"From a vineyard that's actually west of the already coastal Sta. Rita Hills, this wine offers rounded red fruits of strawberry, plum and even watermelon on the nose, along with cinnamon and graphite touches. The palate combines cherries, hibiscus, rose petals and tangy cranberry, sailing through herbal touches into a dried mint flavor that carries deep into the finish."
"There's a slight bit of pleasant funk to the nose of this appellation blend, as well as graphite, sour cherry, soy and shiitake mushroom aromas. The palate is wound around tight acidity, with wild raspberry flavors lifted by incense and pine forest elements."
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Bacchus, Phinny Hill and Loess vineyards. Brooding aromas of black cherry, herb and barrel spice are followed by pitch-black blackberry and game flavors, backed by tightly coiled tannins. It comes off as a bit richer than the norm for this winery but still delivers the goods. Best after 2022."
"Now approaching its peak, this vintage blend balances the three primary Champagne grapes in equal proportion. It's ripe, yet still crisp, with attractive hints of toast and a full, rich, creamy background. Full-bodied and beautiful, it's ready to drink."
"This juicy wine feels substantial, with a concentrated palate of blueberry and blackberry fruit. It's got grip and detail, with threads of coffee grounds and smoke. It finishes with a hint of metallic earth. All is in balance, and the highlights are gently applied."
"This full-bodied, quite ripe red has a classical edge in its grip of pencil led, black currant and dense blackberry fruit. Despite its heft and youthful tannins, it shows promise of aging in its backbone of structure and subtle grace. Enjoy best 2023 through 2028."
"Made entirely with old Nerello Mascalese vines between 80 and 100-years-old, this has aromas of blue flower, ripe berry, exotic spice and a whiff of French oak. The elegant linear palate delivers red cherry, raspberry, chopped herb and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. A mineral note closes the finish. Drink 2018â€“2025."
"Pure Chardonnay from the Grand Cru village of Oger, this wine is creamy and ripe. It also has a chalky mineral mouthfeel that keeps it crisp and tight. With its grapefruit and white stone fruit flavors, it's both fruity and textured. Let it age a few months and drink from 2018."
"This bottling exhibits all of the classic aromas expected from Nebbiolo: tar, rose, dried cherry, sandalwood and cola. The palate offers much of the same, with dried mulberry and rooibos tea touches. The acidity is strong and the tannins are polished but still very structural. Drink nowâ€“2023."

"This blend of 70% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 5% MourvÃ¨dre is a beautiful shade of purple in the glass, and offers aromas of black plum and milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is silky, with zesty acidity that rises through blueberry and boysenberry flavors toward the caramel-layered finish."
"This imposing and extremely ripe tasting wine has an inky dark color, aromas of ripe black cherries, flavors of cassis, espresso and bitter chocolate and a very firm, tannic texture to support all that opulence. Made from half Petite Sirah and half Syrah, it's a no-holds-barred feast of fruit and power."
"Lavishly, densely ripe and fruity, this big, juicy wine has everything in spades, from the nearly black color to the jammy, dessert-like aromas to the saturated blackberry and black fig flavors to a full, opulent body and richly tannic texture. It sure packs a lot of power into each sip."
"Now deliciously mature, this rich wine is smooth and dense. Produced by the CÃ¡lem family, one of the great names of the Douro, the wine is laden with big black fruits and tarry tannins. The wine is very ready to drink."

"From 24 different varieties of old vines, this wine is rich, bold and ripe. Without any wood aging, it is solid with tannins and dense structure. There is a juicy background coming from the blackberry and damson fruits. Drink this serious, ageworthy wine from 2019."

"Aromas of black-skinned berry, new leather, tilled soil and dark spice set the tone on this elegant, firmly structured red. It's still youthfully austere, offering dried cherry, licorice and tobacco set against compact but polished tannins. Give it time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2020â€“2031."

"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, the aromas start out quiet, with notes of cherry, wood spice and dark fruit. The flavors are reserved and polished, showing an exquisite sense of balance and a lingering finish."
"Everything is bigger and bolder in this producer's stable of 2015 Rieslings, and this densely structured beerenauslese is no exception. Its luscious stone fruit flavors and spicy, exotic perfume are undeniably attractive. But it's a softer, plusher style of dessert Riesling atypical of Germany, accentuated by a warm kiss of alcohol on the finish. Drink now through 2022."
"Big and tannic, but tempting and tasty at the same time, this wine tastes ripe, full bodied and fruity, wrapping a blanket of fine tannins around the richness to keep it from being too sweet or overripe. It's half Merlot and half Petite Sirah."
"Condensed dark cherry and plum meet some savory elements on the nose. Silky on entry, with prickling acidity, the medium-bodied palate boasts juicy black-fruit flavors and red-currant acidity. There's enough tannic structure and fruit here to pair alongside hearty grilled fare."
"This wine opens with aromas of vanilla and baking spices that are followed by broad, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors, finishing on a somewhat bitter note. The oak holds a prominent role but still plays its part well."
"Tightly tannic, this 100% varietal wine comes from the producer's family estate. It's big in blackberry fruit and oak, the tannins generous on the palate. Ripe, plush plums figure into the finish, the wine bound to appeal to fans of Zinfandel for its robust nature."
"Dark, brooding tones of oak, caramel and hazelnut form around medium acidity and a full-figured body of voluptuous texture in this Blanc de Blancs, a combination of 95% Chardonnay and 5% Pinot Grigio."
"A very solid wine for the price, this is light in the glass and shows tight cranberry, chipped slate and a slight fruit punch element on the nose. Cranberry returns on the palate, along with raspberries, black pepper and acidity that cuts the rich midpalate."
"The winery's larger-production blend of several vineyard sources, given 20 months in American oak, this wine opens in pungent earth, soy and mushroom, reminiscent of a beef bouillon or beef stew. Big tannins surround the fruit, accented in black licorice and black coffee before finishing lean."

Full and luscious on the palate, rich sultana meets grilled apricot while roasted mixed nuts linger on the finish."

"This is a structured, still young and extracted wine, with dark tannins and spice from the wood aging. In the background, the red-berry fruits are developing and filling out to give a balance to the wine. Drink from 2017."
"From vineyards outside the main village appellations of the CÃ´te de Nuits, this is a firm, almost austere wine. It has a dry extract character that is suppressing the red plum and berry fruit flavors. Give it time, although it is probably always going to be dry."
"Aromas of cassis, underbrush and toast lead the nose on this simple but well-made red. The easy-drinking palate delivers black currant, raspberry, coffee and a toasted note alongside polished tannins. It's made to be enjoyed young so drink soon."
"There's a ripeness of raspberry wrapped in chocolate in this velvety, decadent, thick and viscous wine. Tart on the finish, it remains full bodied in style on the palate, concentrated and extracted."

The warm, hefty palate doles out black cherry marinated in spirits, blackberry extract, licorice and black pepper alongside almost scorching alcohol and tightly knit, close-grained tannins. The evident alcohol dominates the finish."
"Salty, briny and tart, this was aged mostly in stainless steel, with 25% or so barrel-fermented. Ripe in melon and pear, the light-bodied quaff finishes crisp and clean. Hi Vista Vineyard belongs to the longtime owner of the Cliff House Restaurant in San Francisco and is farmed by Ned Hill."
"Smoky, rubbery aromas of plum and foresty berry fruits turn damp and earthy with airing. This feels wiry, with tomato, herbal plum and boysenberry flavors. Barrel spice and toasty oak take over on the finish."
"The nose on this affordably priced wine from the historic winery is shy, though graphite and purple-fruit aromas slowly emerge. The palate shows lots of iron and condensed purple flower flavors."
"A bit light and tight on the nose, this shows condensed strawberries and dried beef aromas before diving into a palate of purple berries. It's an easy-drinking, well-made wine for everyday sipping, just not showing much extra pop."
"Barrel aromas of vanilla, toast and woodspice are at the fore. The palate brings a full feel, with the wood taking over."
"Briny aromas of tomato are low on fruit and and instead show more oak tones. This feels round, saucy and resiny, while the flavor profile is built around oak, briny red fruits, tomato and spice. A solid-feeling finish is modest in terms of flavors."
"This wine is soft and smooth, with just the right amount of acidity to ruffle the surface. An attractive floral character will remain as the wine ages. For now, the acidity and fresh white fruits are young and crisp. Drink from mid-2016."
"Sawdust and campfire notes are the most prominent aromas on this oaky CarmenÃ¨re. Soft tannins and racy acidity create an alert, snappy palate of plum and herbal berry flavors. A note of bitterness darkens the finish."
