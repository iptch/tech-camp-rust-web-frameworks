# Slides

## Building and Presenting

Initialise a Devbox shell to install all required dependencies:

```bash
devbox shell
```

Then build and present the slides:

```bash
just build
just present
```

## Styling

We use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) with [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/) to generate the slides
from Markdown.
